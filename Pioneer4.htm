<p align=center style='text-align:center'><u>RULES OF EVIDENCE<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p><i>The rules of evidence applying to membership in Pioneer Families of
Monroe County follow and are the<br>
standards by which all FFMC* proof is judged. There are no exceptions. The
nature and extent of the<br>
evidence submitted as proof in all applications shall be sufficient to prove
that the applicant is directly<br>
descended from the pioneer ancestor(s) named in Box E of the FFMC application
blank, and sufficient to<br>
differentiate between any two persons of the same name residing in the same
area at the same time. <br>
(*FFMC means First Families of Monroe County.)<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p align=center style='text-align:center'><u>BASIC RULES<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>1. Primary or collateral evidence from vital statistics, courthouse or other
government records, church<br>
records, schools records, etc., is usually considered excellent proof.</p>

<p>2. Secondary evidence, such as census records, newspaper clippings, old
letters, Bible or other family<br>
records CONTEMPORARY TO THE FACTS REPORTED are considered almost as authentic.</p>

<p>3. Circumstantial evidence implied facts or hearsay are not accepted as
proof unless backed up by<br>
primary or secondary evidence.</p>

<p>4. Oral, written, or published family traditions may be wrong and are NOT
accepted as proof.</p>

<p>5. Printed or manuscript genealogies genealogical records or compilations, family
group sheets and<br>
charts, family reunion records and similar material are not considered proof.
Unsupported<br>
information from an amateur or a professional genealogist is not acceptable,
including such records<br>
printed in any genealogical, historical or similar publication.</p>

<p>6. Lineage papers, accepted or unaccepted, from other patriotic or
hereditary societies by themselves are<br>
not considered proof. The document copies, which were used to prove the
lineage, MIGHT be<br>
considered proof for FFMC if they follow these rules.</p>

<p>7. Material authorized by the applicant or a member of his or her family
cannot be considered as proof.</p>

<p>8. Documents used as proof must, either alone or in conjunction with other
acceptable documents,<br>
actually STATE THE FACT TO BE PROVED. Examples of implied proof which are not
acceptable<br>
are: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:.5in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:
auto;margin-left:.5in'>a. Unnamed individuals specified in court records as
&quot;heirs&quot; or &quot;heirs-at-law&quot; unless it is known<br>
that applicable laws at the time included only bloodline descendants.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:.5in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:
auto;margin-left:.5in'>b. Census records, which show the name of the head of
the family only, along with numbers of<br>
family members or others by age group, prove only the family head actually
named. Next door or<br>
close neighbors on a census or tax record do not prove any relationship by
themselves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:.5in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:
auto;margin-left:.5in'>c. A father is not proved as being in an area just
because his child was born there. The birth only<br>
proves the mother was there!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:.5in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:
auto;margin-left:.5in'>d. Owning the same land as an earlier owner does not
necessarily prove Blood descent by the same<br>
name, whether the land was inherited or purchased.</p>

<p>9. Documents written or printed in a foreign language must be accompanied by
a translation into<br>
English and the translation certified as a &quot;true translation&quot; by the
translator (not the applicant or the<br>
family member).</p>

<p>10. Old letters or family records can be accepted as proof for only the
facts that the writer could logically<br>
know as CONTEMPORARY KNOWLEDGE. Identification of the writer and the date is
necessary.<br>
County histories or other published biographies also must have been written by
someone with<br>
contemporary knowledge, or hearsay, to be acceptable.</p>

<p>11. Land or tax records are acceptable only if they specify that the
individual was a resident of Monroe<br>
County, Ohio since many early landowners and speculators never lived in Monroe
County.</p>

<p>12. Female ancestors living in Monroe County, Ohio by December 31, 1850 must
be identified by their<br>
maiden name.</p>

<p>13. A direct line from applicant to pioneer ancestor must be proved at every
step. Collateral descent is<br>
not applicable. Adopted children do not qualify as a step in a lineage, blood
line descent only.</p>

<p>14. All proof documents must state their source. Bible records must include
a photocopy of the title page<br>
with publication date and owner's name.</p>

<p>15. Typed, handwritten or printed copies of original documents must be
certified as a '&quot;True Copy&quot; by a<br>
courthouse or other official or a librarian, etc. An applicant or member of his
or her family cannot<br>
certify a document as a &quot;True Copy.&quot; Photocopies of original
documents are acceptable as copied if<br>
there are no changes on the original.</p>

<p>16. Married female applicants must include a copy of the marriage record to
prove their change of name.</p>

<p>17. Photographs of tombstones are acceptable for proof of birth and death
dates and for relationships<br>
actually stated on the stone. Published compilations of tombstone readings are
acceptable if no<br>
additional information has been written in that is not on the stones
themselves.</p>

<p>18. Reminder: A statement is not necessarily true just because it's in
print.</p>

<p>19. Ancestors who were proved for induction in First Families will be
accepted into Pioneer Families.</p>
