><P 
 align="justify"
><FONT size="+1"></B>In the year 2014 at the time this book was written, we do not know the origin of our Wolf/Wolfe ancestors to America. Our first known Wolfe ancestor was Philip Wolf (1757-1822) who was born in Bedford County, Pennsylvania. According to an historical note found on Ancestry.com, that includes credible data and was quoted from Roots Web&rsquo;s World Connect Project and was originally shared by the Byard Family tree, &ldquo;Philip was born in Bedford County, PA which in that year was still Cumberland County, PA, Bedford being formed in 1771. Philip Wolf was a private in the Revolutionary War, Pennsylvania Line 1776. (Pa Arch Ser 3 Vol 25) The history of Pickaway County says that Philip and Margaret moved to Congo Creek on the Pickaway Plains about 1796. At that time the area was in East Ross Township which later became Pickaway County. Change date: 11 May 2011 at 18:23:21  Sources:   Family History Library   Salt Lake City, Utah 84150&rdquo; </P
><P 
 align="justify"
>Assuming the above note to be correct, Philip Wolfe, moved west to the Pickaway Plains in Ohio shortly after the Ohio Indian population had been defeated and removed from what would become the State of Ohio within about 7-years. Four generations later the children of Earl Russell and Josephine Sybil Worthen Wolfe were born in the same area where Philip Wolfe settled. While a few of the Wolfe family members had wandered away from the original Philip Wolfe homestead, it is that geography that serves as the focus of the Wolfe Family tree that is the subject of this book. </P
><P 
 align="justify"
>For the purpose of exploring the Wolfe family history that follows, our position on the Wolfe family timeline is defined by the period occupied by the young family of Earl and Josephine Wolfe and their children. Roughly, this period coincides with about the first two decades of the 20<Sup><FONT size="+1">th </Sup><FONT size="+1">century. </P
><P 
 align="justify"
>Our journey to explore the Wolfe Family line begins with the Pedigree Chart. So as a reader of this book, imagine yourself being in Pickaway County, Ohio in about 1880, looking back in time at the Wolfe family line. The youngest ancestor that you encounter is Earl Russell Wolfe and his wife, Josephine Sybil Worthen. While it would be wonderful if we could somehow actually view that history, we cannot. So, our next-best option is to view the Pedigree Chart that follows. In this chart, each person in direct lines of our Wolfe, Worthen, and related families is represented by a block or box that contains their name and enough additional information to precisely identify them. By studying these charts, we can develop an overall picture of the Wolfe family line. </P
><P 
 align="justify"
>Since the purpose of the Pedigree Chart is to present only the direct lineage (parent-to-child) relationship, this chart does not include all of the aunts, uncles, and cousins who are also members of the family. These other members of the family, to the extent that we know who they are, will be listed later on the Outline Descendants Chart. </P

The Pedigree Chart that precedes this section can be viewed as a graphical index of this Ahnentafel Report. Incidentally, the word &ldquo;Ahnentafel,&rdquo; means &ldquo;pedigree&rdquo; in German. As with the Pedigree chart, the reader can visualize standing at our focus point of the Wolfe timeline and looking back into history at the array of preceding ancestors. </P

>Where any relevant information could be found it was included in this Ahnentafel Report section. For this reason, bits of information such as census reports, birth and death records, marriage records, obituaries, etc. have been included in this section. By studying these records the reader can frequently find information about an ancestor such as where they were born, lived and died; what kinds of work they did; the number and names of their children; and much, much more. In more recent years, relatives or reporters may have written essays, newspaper articles, impressions or comments that help identify and characterize an ancestor. All such information has been included. </P

>Keep in mind as you read this material that the exploration of each of the four major family lines (Wolfe, List, Fischer, and Dresbach) has been organized in a similar way.

>Josephine Sybil Worthen was a small lady measuring 5-feet 3-inches tall. She was very pretty, even in her older years. She had brown eyes and brown hair. She was soft spoken and intelligent. In spite of her small size her life as a farm wife and her circumstances required that she be strong, creative and hard working; a role that she performed admirably. </P
><P 

>Josephine Sybil Worthen was born 1 Oct 1884 in Meigs County, Ohio and died 31 Dec 1977 in Pickaway Co., Ohio. Her parents were Aaron Benjamin Worthen and Elizabeth Morris. Her mother, Elizabeth Morris Worthen, died on 5 July 1894 at the age of 38-years. Josephine was only 9-years and 9-months old when her mother died. After her mother's death, Josephine's grandmother, Agnes Moore Morris, helped care for the Aaron B. Worthen family. Her care was limited, however, because she lived 3-miles away. In 4-short-years from Josephine's mother's death, her grandmother Agnes also died. Aaron had remarried and shortly after her grandmother Agnes' death, Josephine, then about 14-years old, went to live with her Uncle James Worthen's family. Josephine apparently quit school when she moved to the James Worthen household leaving her with only an 8th grade education. James, her father's brother, was over 19-years older than Aaron. James was also a farmer and had a large family of his own. It was while she lived with her Uncle James that Josephine met Earl Russell Wolfe who was a friend of James Worthen. Josephine and Earl married on 22 Jun 1902 in Denver, Ohio. Josephine was 17-years and 8 months old when she and Earl married. Earl was 23-years and 8-months old. </P

They entered this farm, (Camp Lewis Farm) which was government land, in 1797, and built on the spot where the present house now stands. The farm has been in the Wolfe name for 112 years. It is noted in early Ohio history, as being the land on which Col. Lewis camped in 1774, while negotiating a treaty with the Shawnee and Wyandotte Indians. Mr. Wolfe lived his long, contented and happy life on this spot from birth to death. He was united in marriage to Clara W. Bunn, April 18, 1865. To them were born a family of eight children, seven of whom are living. George, the eldest, died when 26 years of age. </P

At some point, I asked her if I could have it, and she said okay. The book is Gray&rsquo;s School and Field Book of Botany, published in 1857. It is signed by Clara&rsquo;s son, George C. Wolfe.

><P 
 align="justify"
><FONT size="+1"></B>One of the limitations of the reader &lsquo;standing&rsquo; at a focus-point on the family timeline and viewing direct ancestors as we gaze back in history, is that we miss the aunts, uncles and cousins that help make up the family line. One way to overcome this limitation is to go to the oldest known ancestor on the timeline and view the family as his/her descendants. That is, view the family members on the timeline from the earliest known, or oldest, member, to the newest, current member. A chart that views the family members in this way is called an Outline Descendant Report. It is called an &ldquo;Outline&rdquo; report because it does not include all of the details of each individual. Instead it list the names and selected information (date-of-birth, marriage, death, and location of each when they are available) of all known family members who are the descendants of that oldest known ancestor. </P
><P 
 align="justify"
>The order in which descendants are arranged on the Outline Descendant Report indicates their relationship to the oldest known ancestor, and therefore their relationship to each other. On this report the oldest known ancestor is identified as &ldquo;Generation 1.&rdquo; His/her children are identified as &ldquo;Generation 2,&rdquo; and so on. </P

 align="justify"
><FONT size="+1"></B>The section that follows is the Ahnentafel Report for Josephine Sybil WorthenWolfe. The Pedigree Chart that appeared earlier on page 2 can be viewed as a graphical index of this Ahnentafel Report, also. Recall that the word &ldquo;Ahnentafel,&rdquo; means &ldquo;pedigree&rdquo; in German. As with the Pedigree chart, the reader can visualize standing at our focus-point of the Wolfe timeline and looking back into history at the array of preceding ancestors. In this case, we are looking back the Worthen ancestral line. Beginning with Josephine Sybil Worthen Wolfe, this section contains everything that we know about the direct line of Worthen ancestors back to George Worthen (1604-1642). </P
><P 
 align="justify"
>Without the benefit of photographs, portraits or other personal information we are dependent on information such as census reports, birth and death records, marriage records, obituaries, etc. to help develop a profile of each ancestor. By studying these records the reader can frequently find information about an ancestor such as when and where they were born, lived and died; what kinds of work they did; the number and names of their children; and much, much more. </P
><P 
 align="justify"
>Keep in mind as you read this material that the exploration of each of the four major family lines (Wolfe, List, Fischer, and Dresbach) has been organized in a similar way. Also a similar organization is used in the case of spousal Wolfe members&rsquo; family lines (Worthen, Foster, List, Fischer, Dresbach). <FONT size="+1">The organization of the sections of this book is described beginning on page iv. </P

>Earl was a big man standing 6-feet and 1-inch tall. He had blue eyes and brown hair. He was a farmer most of his life except for a short time following his marriage to Josephine Worthen when he worked for the railroad. He loved horses, was a good checker player, smoked cigars and collected Indian relics such as arrow heads and stone axes. </P
><P 

>On January 27, 2005 Suzanne Kay Wolfe Mettle (1943-2012) interviewed her father, Roger Earl Wolfe, about Earl Russell Wolfe. When Suzanne asked Roger about his father's health, he replied: &quot;He (Earl Russell Wolfe) had poor health when I was small. I could hardly reach him when I started shaving him. He had had a stroke and his right hand was paralized. I was glad when the safety razor was available. I would cut off his face-mole about once a month with the old razor. [Suzanne's note: This was at Fox Farm -1926-19??. Roger was six in 1926.] </P
><P 

>His brother Russell and sister Dorothy both married their spouces in 1929. So by 1929 Roger was the oldest boy at home and he had much responsibility at an early age. He said his mother [Josephine Sybil Worthen Wolfe] worked terribly hard. </P
><P 

>Roger went to California in 1938. He was there 16 years. Josephine said Russell was laid off from his job, lost his new house and savings. He was helped out by Earl who rented a farm for him. For 3-years he used his father's equipment. Earl told Roger he was sorry he couldn't help him more, financially. </P
><P 

>Roger remembers his dad, Earl, having three cars while he was still living at home: #1 <U>(an unknown model)</U>, #2 a Rio, #3 a Hup mobile. For the first car he went with a salesman to Detroit and another man. They brought 3 cars home -each driving a car. It was the first time driving it. </P
><P 

>At the end of his life, Earl became quite difficult and aggressive. He became progressively abusive toward his wife, Josephine, and eventually was admitted to the Columbus State Hospital where he died on 27 March 1951. </P

><P 
 align="justify"
><FONT size="+1"></B>One of the limitations of the reader &lsquo;standing&rsquo; at a focus-point on the family timeline and viewing direct ancestors as we gaze back in history, is that we miss the aunts, uncles and cousins that help make up the family line. One way to overcome this limitation is to go to the oldest known ancestor on the timeline and view the family as his/her descendants. That is, view the family members on the timeline from the earliest known, or oldest, member, to the newest, current member. A chart that views the family members in this way is called an Outline Descendant Report. It is called an &rdquo;Outline&rdquo; report because it does not include all of the details of each individual. Instead it list the names and selected information (date-of-birth, marriage, death, and location of each when they are available) of all known family members who are the descendants of that oldest known ancestor. </P
><P 
 align="justify"
>The order in which descendants are arranged on the Outline Descendant Report indicates their relationship to the oldest known ancestor, and therefore their relationship to each other. On this report the oldest known ancestor is identified as &ldquo;Generation 1.&rdquo; His/her children are identified as &ldquo;Generation 2,&rdquo; and so on. </P

><P 
 align="justify"
><FONT size="+1"></B>We believe that the first American immigrant of the Foster line may have been Benjamin Foster (?-1758) from England. While Benjamin Foster is the first known ancestor in the Foster line we cannot be certain that he was the immigrant ancestor. The reason for the uncertainty is that while we find his name as the father of Jabez Foster (1754-1818) and the husband of Sarah French II, Jabez&rsquo;s mother, little else is known of him. We know his year of death only because he was involved in the expedition against the French at Crown Point in the French and Indian War and was killed in that battle. </P
><P 
 align="justify"
>Jabez, son of Benjamin and Sarah French II Foster was born in Connecticut in 1754 which could be where the family first settled in America. The Jabez family moved to Vermont sometime before 1786 where they remained for 3-generations. </P
><P 
 align="justify"
>Sometime between 1850 and 1860 Benjamin Foster&rsquo;s great grandson, Charles Foster (1812-1868) moved his entire family of his wife, Lavina Thompson Foster, and their 5 children from Vermont to the Pickaway Plains. One of Charles Foster&rsquo;s sons, Alson Coleman Foster (1844-1910), was the father of Mary Helen Foster (1905-1996) who married into the Wolfe family in 1929. Mary Foster Wolfe and her husband Russell Franklin Wolfe were both born in Pickaway County, Ohio. Except for a brief period following their marriage, they lived their full lives and died within a few miles of their birthplace. </P

>My mother was an attractive woman with short dark hair. She was a flapper in the 20's and wore a lace flapper style dress in navy blue for her wedding to my Dad on June 15, 1929. After attending Normal School for one year she was an elementary teacher and taught school until Lois was born in 1931. Mama had many talents, skills and patience and taught and helped us her whole life. She also had a good sense of humor and said things that made us laugh. She taught Lois and me to embroider, to sew, knit and crochet. We made candy and popcorn balls together during the holidays, and baked and decorated cookies and colored and decorated Easter eggs. We females did the weekly wash and hung loads of washing on the clothes line, and we did the weekly house cleaning on Saturdays and tons of dishwashing. Lois and I often sang while we washed and dried dishes, I think to pass the time more quickly. Our Mother also helped our brothers make kites or puppets and rubber band guns and other projects. She seldom sat down. </P
><P 

>In the summer she canned food from the garden and the kitchen would be hot and steamy with boiling jars that had been stored in the basement, and pots of bubbly tomatoes, beans, fruits or jams that had to be sealed in the jars in boiling water. And she sewed and knitted many clothes for her girls and grandchildren, as well as sewing pillow cases, tea towels, doll clothes, teddy bears, puppets and more. She encouraged our arts and crafts and school work. Our family always went to all the Kingston basketball games especially since all my brothers played basketball, so Friday nights were busy getting everyone fed and off to the games. </P
><P 

>She was an active member of the PTA, Eastern Star, the garden club and church circle. She helped with our 4-H clubs, our Brownie and Girl Scout troops, and other groups and projects where she was needed, and was happy, non-complaining and smiling with it all. Every one loved her as she did them. </P

Mary Helen Foster Wolfe. 
</P
><P 

>Russell Franklin Wolfe 
(By daughter Mary Jo McCall) 
</P
><P 

>My Dad (we called Daddy) was a tall, thick chested man with lots of dark hair and I always 
considered him very handsome. He was kind and quiet and smart. He really liked keeping up with 
world news and local events and had lots of information which he often didn't volunteer to share, 
though he would if asked and give his opinions when engaged in conversation. He could fix 
anything -cars, washers, toasters, bicycles, lawn mowers, anything at all I think, and always had a 
project going in the garage with zillions of tools. He was always generous and willing to help out. 
In the 50's he invited a family of three to live in their house trailer in our back yard in Kingston for 
several months, as they were having a hard time. 
</P
><P 

>When I was three our family moved from the Wolfe farm on Wolfe Road to Kingston, Ohio where 
my parents had bought an eight room house. Daddy was still remodeling the kitchen and back 
porch, mending the roof and digging a well in the back yard when we moved in. Granddad Hickle, 
Mary's stepfather, assisted Daddy in the house remodel. Daddy was a hard working man all his 
life. 
</P
><P 

>He taught my brothers how to fix their bikes and cars and build things, like a cart which my brother 
Philip used for hauling corn cobs or leaves or whatever needed to be moved. He teased my sister 
and me a little and said one of us was smart and the other was pretty. We never knew which was 
which. He paid a nickel to me for every lost button I sewed on his shirts, and I collected the lost 
change which fell from his pockets when he finally took a rest on the couch in the evenings. Once I 
painted his toenails red when he was napping, and he let it wear off rather than use remover. 
</P
><P 

>My parents liked traveling occasionally and I think a fun part for Daddy was planning the trips and 
studying the maps and travel information. He really enjoyed finding interesting places to visit and 
some of those stops were on their trips to California when they visited me, or to Florida or Michigan 
when they visited Philip's and Lois's families. He liked to go fishing on the weekends occasionally 
in his small motor boat and when I was a kid he sometimes would bring home catfish he'd caught 
in the river and our Mother would fry them. In their retirement they had intended to travel more but 
that plan was cut short when Daddy was shot by a mentally unstable neighbor in 1979. 
</P
><P 

>Sometimes Daddy played his old trombone or violin for us. He also had a drum he had played in 
the Kingston Community Band which was later donated to the Ross County Museum. We kids 
always liked that he played and we found it fun. 
</P
><P 

>Daddy was on the Kingston City Council for years, and he was a Mason in the Kingston lodge, and 
active in The Mt. Pleasant Presbyterian Church. He was respected and loved by the towns people 
and his Masonic brothers as well as the people he worked with, and even more so by his wife Mary 
and family.

>When I was little, I used to look through a botany textbook that Grandma Wolfe kept around. At some point, I asked her if I could have it, and she said okay. The book is Gray&rsquo;s School and Field Book of Botany, published in 1857. It is signed by Clara&rsquo;s son, George C. Wolfe. The fly page reads, &ldquo;G. C. Wolfe, Kingston, Ohio, March 7 -1887 -&ldquo; If my reading of the family tree is correct, George had five years left to make it to Elreno before he died, and he didn&rsquo;t take the book. </P
><P 

>I also have some school records and memorabilia that belonged to Grandpa Wolfe (Russell Franklin). Some of the school documents are signed by Josephine Sybil Worthen (as Mrs. Earl Russell Wolfe). One of these is a largish envelope sent from a seed company to Mrs. Earl Russell Wolfe for the Camp Lewis Farm. I also have Pickaway High graduation invitations from 1920 and 1924, and various calling cards from people I don&rsquo;t know. </P
><P 

>Much of what I have concerns Grandpa&rsquo;s involvement with Davey Tree. I have a set of letters and instructions books from the Davey Institute of Tree Surgery, Kent, Ohio. The books date from the teens and twenties. As I remember, Grandpa Wolfe&rsquo;s dream was to be a tree surgeon. He graduated from Pickaway High in 1924 and was accepted into the Davey program, but was called back to the farm when his father died in March of 1925. (Davey Tree was about 35 years old then, and is now one of the big players in tree service. According to a website, Davey Tree &ldquo;has annual revenue of $500 million to $1 billion and employs a staff of approximately 5,000 to 9,999.&rdquo;). </P
><P 

>The family tree shows me marrying Donna Louise Morgan. As she was Donna Louise Lindner when I met her, her kids are Edward and Sarah Lindner. Sarah has two kids, Malachi and Ross, who have different names [surnames]. </P

>Russell died from being shot in the back by a deranged Vietnam War veteran who lived across the street. Mentally, the neighbor never left the battle field in Vietnam. He had shot at several passing automobiles prior to his attack on Russell. Russell was shoveling snow from the sidewalk between his house and garage when he was shot in the back with a 22 caliber rifle from the neighbor's bedroom window. </P

></B>Notes for Michael McClellan: 
Michael and his wife, Jane Henry, came to the colonies about 1749-1750. Michael was the son of 
Hugh McClellan who died in Maghera, Ireland in 1739. Michael named his son after his father (The 
&quot;Hugh&quot; mentioned as a soldier in the Revolution). It seems that the McClellans had lived in Ireland 
since about 1650. Prior to that the McClellan family had lived in Kirkendbrightshire, in Galloway, 
Scotland. Eight children came with Michael and his wife to the colonies, including their oldest 
daughter, Jeannet and her husband, Michael. Michael and Jane became alarmed at the growing 
number of Indian attacks at the beginning of the French and Indian Wars and, therefore, moved 
their family from Colrain, Mass. to Pelham, Mass. Michael ran out of money and was forced to 
work as a lumberjack. While working he got pneumonia and died. Jane returned after living briefly 
in Chester, N.H. and Concord, Mass. to Colrain until her heath failed on August 11, 1777. She is 
buried in the Chandler Hill Cemetery in Colrain. Michael's place of burial is unknown.

>My mother was an attractive woman with short dark hair. She was a flapper in the 20's and wore a lace flapper style dress in navy blue for her wedding to my Dad on June 15, 1929. After attending Normal School for one year she was an elementary teacher and taught school until Lois was born in 1931. Mama had many talents, skills and patience and taught and helped us her whole life. She also had a good sense of humor and said things that made us laugh. She taught Lois and me to embroider, to sew, knit and crochet. We made candy and popcorn balls together during the holidays, and baked and decorated cookies and colored and decorated Easter eggs. We females did the weekly wash and hung loads of washing on the clothes line, and we did the weekly house cleaning on Saturdays and tons of dishwashing. Lois and I often sang while we washed and dried dishes, I think to pass the time more quickly. Our Mother also helped our brothers make kites or puppets and rubber band guns and other projects. She seldom sat down. </P
><P 

>In the summer she canned food from the garden and the kitchen would be hot and steamy with boiling jars that had been stored in the basement, and pots of bubbly tomatoes, beans, fruits or jams that had to be sealed in the jars in boiling water. And she sewed and knitted many clothes for her girls and grandchildren, as well as sewing pillow cases, tea towels, doll clothes, teddy bears, puppets and more. She encouraged our arts and crafts and school work. Our family always went to all the Kingston basketball games especially since all my brothers played basketball, so Friday nights were busy getting everyone fed and off to the games. </P
><P 

>She was an active member of the PTA, Eastern Star, the garden club and church circle. She helped with our 4-H clubs, our Brownie and Girl Scout troops, and other groups and projects where she was needed, and was happy, non-complaining and smiling with it all. Every one loved her as she did them. </P

Mary Helen Foster Wolfe. 
</P

>Russell Franklin Wolfe 
(By daughter Mary Jo McCall) 
</P
><P 

>My Dad (we called Daddy) was a tall, thick chested man with lots of dark hair and I always 
considered him very handsome. He was kind and quiet and smart. He really liked keeping up with 
world news and local events and had lots of information which he often didn't volunteer to share, 
though he would if asked and give his opinions when engaged in conversation. He could fix 
anything -cars, washers, toasters, bicycles, lawn mowers, anything at all I think, and always had a 
project going in the garage with zillions of tools. He was always generous and willing to help out. 
In the 50's he invited a family of three to live in their house trailer in our back yard in Kingston for 
several months, as they were having a hard time. 
</P
><P 

>When I was three our family moved from the Wolfe farm on Wolfe Road to Kingston, Ohio where 
my parents had bought an eight room house. Daddy was still remodeling the kitchen and back 
porch, mending the roof and digging a well in the back yard when we moved in. Granddad Hickle, 
Mary's stepfather, assisted Daddy in the house remodel. Daddy was a hard working man all his 
life. 
</P
><P 

>He taught my brothers how to fix their bikes and cars and build things, like a cart which my brother 
Philip used for hauling corn cobs or leaves or whatever needed to be moved. He teased my sister 
and me a little and said one of us was smart and the other was pretty. We never knew which was 
which. He paid a nickel to me for every lost button I sewed on his shirts, and I collected the lost 
change which fell from his pockets when he finally took a rest on the couch in the evenings. Once I 
painted his toenails red when he was napping, and he let it wear off rather than use remover. 
</P
><P 

>My parents liked traveling occasionally and I think a fun part for Daddy was planning the trips and 
studying the maps and travel information. He really enjoyed finding interesting places to visit and 
some of those stops were on their trips to California when they visited me, or to Florida or Michigan 
when they visited Philip's and Lois's families. He liked to go fishing on the weekends occasionally 
in his small motor boat and when I was a kid he sometimes would bring home catfish he'd caught 
in the river and our Mother would fry them. In their retirement they had intended to travel more but 
that plan was cut short when Daddy was shot by a mentally unstable neighbor in 1979. 
</P
><P 

>Sometimes Daddy played his old trombone or violin for us. He also had a drum he had played in 
the Kingston Community Band which was later donated to the Ross County Museum. We kids 
always liked that he played and we found it fun. 
</P
><P 

>Daddy was on the Kingston City Council for years, and he was a Mason in the Kingston lodge, and 
active in The Mt. Pleasant Presbyterian Church. He was respected and loved by the towns people 
and his Masonic brothers as well as the people he worked with, and even more so by his wife Mary 
and family.

>When I was little, I used to look through a botany textbook that Grandma Wolfe kept around. At some point, I asked her if I could have it, and she said okay. The book is Gray&rsquo;s School and Field Book of Botany, published in 1857. It is signed by Clara&rsquo;s son, George C. Wolfe. The fly page reads, &ldquo;G. C. Wolfe, Kingston, Ohio, March 7 -1887 -&ldquo; If my reading of the family tree is correct, George had five years left to make it to Elreno before he died, and he didn&rsquo;t take the book. </P
><P 

>I also have some school records and memorabilia that belonged to Grandpa Wolfe (Russell Franklin). Some of the school documents are signed by Josephine Sybil Worthen (as Mrs. Earl Russell Wolfe). One of these is a largish envelope sent from a seed company to Mrs. Earl Russell Wolfe for the Camp Lewis Farm. I also have Pickaway High graduation invitations from 1920 and 1924, and various calling cards from people I don&rsquo;t know. </P
><P 

>Much of what I have concerns Grandpa&rsquo;s involvement with Davey Tree. I have a set of letters and instructions books from the Davey Institute of Tree Surgery, Kent, Ohio. The books date from the teens and twenties. As I remember, Grandpa Wolfe&rsquo;s dream was to be a tree surgeon. He graduated from Pickaway High in 1924 and was accepted into the Davey program, but was called back to the farm when his father died in March of 1925. (Davey Tree was about 35 years old then, and is now one of the big players in tree service. According to a website, Davey Tree &ldquo;has annual revenue of $500 million to $1 billion and employs a staff of approximately 5,000 to 9,999.&rdquo;). </P
><P 

>The family tree shows me marrying Donna Louise Morgan. As she was Donna Louise Lindner when I met her, her kids are Edward and Sarah Lindner. Sarah has two kids, Malachi and Ross, who have different names [surnames]. </P

><P 

><FONT color="#000000"></B>Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Edward Harrington is the son of Ira Edward and Audra Lavada Young. He was the spouse of Lois Anne Wolfe. </P
><P 

>Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Edward Harrington was the first born child of Ira Edward and Audra Lavada Young Harrington. He was born 23 December 1931 in Grant Hospital, Columbus, Ohio. The Nation was in the grips of the Great Depression and the majority of the world's citizens were impacted in one way or other. For the Ira and Audra Harrington family, it meant a move from Ohio to Miami, Florida. The Ira Harrington family and his sister Ruth Pennell family decided to start their own business catching and selling fish. About two months after Dick was born, the families drove to Florida, built a fishing boat and went into business. Audra found the move not to her liking and spent most of her time caring for Dick in their new environment. While the new business was a success up to the point of catching fish, there was almost no market for the product. By June of 1932 it became obvious that the business was not making enough money to support the two families. </P
><P 

>On 26 July 1932 Ira and Ruth received word that their baby sister, Easter Marie Harrington Thompson, had died suddenly and unexpectedly the previous day. Immediately the Ira Harrington family set off in their Model-A Ford on a marathon, non-stop (except to buy fuel) 21-hour drive from Miami, Florida to Circleville, Ohio to attend Easter's funeral. Heartbroken and exhausted, they arrived in time for the funeral. The Ira Harrington family never returned to Miami. And so began the life of their first child, Richard E. Harrington. </P
><P 

>On 10 March 1933, within 8-months of the return of the Ira Harrington family to Circleville, Ohio a second son was born, William Young Harrington. The economy was still grim and Ira's job was barely breaking even. Ira and Audra decided to avoid the expense of rent by buying a 4-acre plot of land with a run-down brick house on it. They borrowed the total purchase price of the property, $600, from Audra's parents who were farmers in Monroe County, Ohio. The house provided a rent-free home while the land was sufficient to provide most of their food from a large garden and sufficient pasture for a cow and some pigs. Ira continued to work for a meager wage at the paper plant in Circleville and supplemented the table by hunting and fishing, both avocations which he loved. </P
><P 

>The 4-acre farm proved to be Dick's home for over the next 12 years while he attended school from 1st through 12th grades at Pickaway Township School. In 1949 after graduating from high school and working the summer in his father's welding shop, Dick entered a 5-year, college of Chemical Engineering at The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. </P
><P 

>College was never a priority in the Harrington family. In fact, it was never seriously considered by any family members including Dick. Both the Ira Harrington and Audra Young families desended from a long line of farmers where college was not considered necessary or even beneficial. Being on the cusp of recovery from the Great Depression, college was not economically possible. Dick describes his path through college as an anomily -almost an accident. He gives his high school principal, John Hardin, all the credit for his going to college. As graduation approached, John Hardin asked Dick what he was planning to do after graduation. Dick had no idea so John </P
><P 

><FONT size="+1"><B>Generation 2 (con't) </P
><P 
 align=""
><FONT size="+1"></B>planning graduation. Hardin asked if he ever considered going to college. He gave Dick an Ohio State University course catalog and suggested he peruse it calling attention to the courses in chemical engineering, an area where Dick had shown an interest high school. Unknown to Dick, John Hardin applied for a scholarship for him at The Ohio State University. During the summer following high school graduation, John took Dick to the University to register. John worked with the registrar's office to secure a work-for-room situation with one of the professors at OSU. </P
><P 

>Dick was not strongly motivated to go to college. While the idea was enticing, it was foreign. With no other option other than working for his father in his welding shop business, Dick decided to try a quarter -maybe a year -studying engineering classes with the idea that even one year of college might help land a job as a draftsman. And so college began with the understanding that any further progress would require that he earn enough money to pay for his own tuition, room and board. </P
><P 

>Being still 17-years old when he graduated from high school and entered college, Dick was still too young for the draft that was still in effect from the World War II military effort. By the following year, after turning 18-years old, the draft was a real threat to interrupt completion of college. Dick joined the Naval Reserves during his first year at The Ohio State University and in early 1950 signed up for the US Naval Reserve Officer's Training (NROTC) program. This program required summer training at Newport, Road Island's Narragansett Naval Training Center following the first year of college and a final training session the year before graduation. Protection from the draft during college years, however, was assurred. Upon completion of a degree as a Chemical Engineer, the contract required going onto active duty for 2-years. </P
><P 

>In the sophmore year of the 5-year Chemical Engineering program, Dick re-met a lovely young lady, Lois Ann Wolfe, through her first cousin, Ronald Luther List. Lois was going to college at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio. It was a re-meeting because Lois and Dick had both gone to Pickaway Twp. School together, in the 1st-through-3rd grades. Lois was studying to become a teacher at Ohio University. They dated for well over a year and married on 25 September 1952. That year Lois changed schools from Ohio University to The Ohio State University where she finished her degree in elementary teaching. The next year she taught 2nd grade in the Westerville school system. Dick worked at Varo Engineering Corp., a small civil engineering firm in Columbus, Ohio as a draftsman until he graduated in the Autumn quarter of 1954. Dick was the first college graduate in his Harrington family and the second in his extended family. On 15 January 1955 their first son, Daniel Edward Harrington, was born at the Ohio State University Hospital. </P
><P 

>Dick's first job in Pensacola, Florida was with the Chemstrand Corporation, a large plant that made nylon for every concevible end-use ranging from women's nylon hose to heavy-duty truck tires and parachutes. It was a permanent job but one to be soon interrupted to satisfy the terms of the NROTC program. In June of 1955 Dick reported to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii for duty aboard the USS Current, ARS-22. Lois and Daniel soon moved to Pearl Harbor where they lived in a house on a section of the base for Naval Officers. Dick lived with his family when his ship was in Pearl Harbor but he was at sea about a third of the time. With a long deployment coming up for the USS Current ARS-22, Lois and Dan returned to Ohio where Gregory Phillip Harrington was born on 26 June 1957. Following a 27-month tour of duty (May 1955 -August 1957), Dick and his family returned to Pensacola, Florida where they lived for the next 6-years. Pamela Ann Harrington was born in Pensacola on 20 June 1958, Margaret (Peggy) Elaine Harrington was born on 9 May 1960 and Neil William Harrington was born on 17 June 1963. </P

>When people are faced with adversity, they do one of two things: feel sorry </P
><P 

>for themselves, or don't. In most cases, people choose the former because it is the </P
><P 

>easy way to deal with the situation. </P
><P 

>It's easy to complain and ask why me? It's easy to take it out on the people around you because hey, you think you have the right to do so. </P
><P 

>But every once in awhile we see someone who takes the opposite </P
><P 

>approach, and it's even more remarkable when that someone is barely old enough </P
><P 

>to drive. </P
><P 

>Enter Rick Schwartz, a sophomore at Lutheran Westland High School. Up </P
><P 

>until a few months ago, Rick was your typical student. He played basketball and ran </P
><P 

>track for Lutheran Westland. He also dabbles on the electric guitar. </P
><P 

>In mid-November Rick was supposed to go on a hunting trip with his dad, </P
><P 

>Jack. Rick ended up not going on the trip because he was not feeling well. He </P
><P 

>began complaining about pains in his shoulder that Saturday, thinking he may of </P
><P 

>pulled a muscle. </P
><P 

>&quot;I went to school on Monday and went to basketball tryouts,'' Rick said. &quot; I </P
><P 

>did some of the drills but wasn't able to complete all of them.'' Rick and his mother, Pam went to doctor the following day to find out what </P
><P 

>the problem was. </P
><P 

>&quot;We went to the doctor thinking that it was just a pulled muscle, but we </P
><P 

>ended up in emergency,'' Pam said. &quot;It turned out that Rick didn't have a pulled </P
><P 

>muscle, but his left lung had collapsed.'' </P
><P 

>After a closer examination, doctors realized that both lungs were collapsing. </P
><P 

>It was fortunate that Rick did not go on the hunting trip up in Porcupine Mountains </P
><P 

>with his dad because doctors said he would not have survived. </P
><P 

>&quot;I kept thinking about what would have happened if he went up there,'' Jack </P
><P 

>said. &quot;I might have come back from hunting and found him there gasping for breath. </P
><P 

>There is no doubt in my mind that he would have died.&quot; </P
><P 

>Rick was hospitalized 10 days where he underwent a procedure which </P
><P 

>placed a tube in both of his lungs. The tube sucked out the escaped air in the chest </P
><P 

>cavity to allow the lung to expand normally. </P
><P 

>The tubes were removed and Rick was sent on his way with seemingly </P
><P 

><FONT size="+1"><B>Generation 3 (con't) </P
><P 
 align=""
><FONT size="+1"></B>way seemingly everything under control. Unfortunately, he had to go back into the hospital a few days later because his left lung collapsed again. </P
><P 

>His second visit lasted another week to repair his left lung. Rick was only out of the hospital a few days before he had to go back a third time because his right lung collapsed. </P
><P 

>During his last two visits, not only did he have to get the tubes reinserted, but he was also given tetracycline, a drug used to aggravate the lungs. </P
><P 

>&quot;The bad part about the tetracycline was that it burned pretty bad, so I was constantly taking morphine to ease the pain,'' Rick said. &quot;I was allowed to give it to myself manually, but every morning around 4, I had to have a nurse come in and give it to me because it burned so bad.'' </P
><P 

>Despite everything that Rick was going through, he never let down. </P
><P 

>&quot;For as horrible as this experience was, I have some fond memories,'' Pam Schwartz said. &quot;We got to see the kind of person that our son was. He was always polite and joking around. He remained positive throughout the whole ordeal.'' </P
><P 

>On Christmas Eve of last year, Rick was finally going home for good. When he got home there was plenty of homework awaiting him from the time he missed, but that didn't faze him. </P
><P 

>&quot;The teachers kept telling him to slow down, but Rick kept pushing forward to get his work done,&quot; Pam said. </P
><P 

>Rick returned to school a week before his finals and was able to pull all A's and one B for the quarter. At the same time he began to resume his workouts with the basketball team. </P
><P 

>Right now, Rick is still maintaining his outstanding work in classroom, while playing an integral part of Lutheran Westland's Metro Conference championship track team. He runs the 300-meter hurdles, 800 and 1,600 relays, along with 200 dash. </P
><P 

>So while life has returned back to normal in the Schwartz household, it makes them realize how lucky they really are. </P
><P 

>&quot;You really pick up an appreciation for parents who have to go through this all of the time, having to take kids in and out of the hospital on a consistent basis,&quot; said Jack. </P
><P 
 align=""
>So instead of whining and complaining about the whole world being against you and lamenting why me, remember Rick's story. Teenagers, every once in awhile, can teach all of us adults a thing or two. gstephens@oe.homecomm.net|(734) 953-2014 </P

><P 
 align="center"
>Edward and Lois Ann Wolfe Harrington. She lived in Pensacola 3-1/2 years, then moved with her </P

><P 
 align="center"

><P 
 align="center"
>Cincinnati, OH and finally to Ann Arbor, MI as her father's job with the U.S. Government changed </P
><P 

>locations. Peggy graduated from Dexter High School in Dexter, Michigan in 1978. She went to </P
><P 

>Sienna Heights College for about one semester, then moved to Ann Arbor where she worked for </P
><P 

>J.C. Penney for a while, then moved on to a job at a Total gas station. Her first car was a VW Karmann Ghia. At the age of 20-years she met and married Michael Clark Poole on 24 May 1980. </P
><P 

>Peg and Mike moved to Newport News, VA in March of 1981, then to Gloucester in 1983 </P
><P 

>where they bought their first house and started their family. Their first daughter, Eryn Leigh Poole, </P
><P 

>was born 25 May 1982. On 20 May 1984 their second daughter, Morgan Kendall Poole, was born. </P
><P 

>While Morgan was the last biological family member, she was not the last family member. On 29 </P
><P 

>July 1999 Mike and Peggy traveled to China and adopted a beautiful little girl, Emily Yan Li Poole, </P
><P 

>from a State orphanage. At that time, China was enforcing a one-child rule for its citizens and </P
><P 

>combined with the cultural preference for sons, Emily had been abandoned on the steps of a </P
><P 

>government building. She was in good health and less than a year old. No records exist regarding </P
><P 

>her parents or her age other than her given name, Yan Li. Emily was quickly integrated into the </P
><P 

>Mike Poole family and soon earned a favorite position among her adopted parents and two older </P
><P 

>sisters, Eryn and Morgan. The family soon gave her their best-estimate birthday of 20 September </P
><P 

>1998. They now celebrate both the &quot;birthday&quot; of 20 September and a &quot;Gotcha&quot; day of 29 July. </P
><P 

>In August of 2001, Holly Che, a 16 year old Chinese student came from China to live with </P
><P 

>the Mike and Peggy Poole family as a one-year exchange student. See the bio-sketch for Holly </P
><P 

>below. </P
><P 

>As the family grew older, Peggy resumed her education by attending Thomas Nelson Community College where she earned an Associate degree in nursing in May 1990. She sat for her board-exams and became a Registered Nurse the same year. Armed with her RN, Peggy worked in Med-surgery, Telemetry, and Critical Care at Riverside Walter Reed Hospital in Gloucester, VA for several years. In 1995 she worked in Riverside Walter Reed Home Health where she became supervisor for about 7-years of a staff of over 20 home-health care nurses. She continued her advanced studies at the Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) and earned her Bachelors of Science in Nursing in December 2012. In 2014 she returned to college full-time at VCU, while retaining her job at Riverside Walter Reed as a part-time home-health nurse, to get her masters degree in the area of Acute Care Nurse Practitioner (ACNP). She is scheduled to graduate in May 2015 and will sit for her ACNP boards soon after. </P

During that period, she saw her father on weekends. Holly commented, &quot;My parents give me freedom to choose whoever I want to live with.&quot; </P
><P 

>In China, Holly resides in the mountainous area of the province of Kunming where she was </P
><P 
 align="center"
>born September 11, 1985. There she attended the &quot;No. 26 Middle School&quot; and &quot;No. 8 High </P
><P 
 align="center"
>School&quot; in Kunming. In China, there are 6 years elementary school, 3 years middle school and 3 </P
><P 

>years high school. In middle school, Holly studied English for all 3 years. She became interested </P
><P 

>in and was encouraged by her parents to participate in a student exchange program in the United </P
><P 

>States where she could increase her English speaking proficiency. Holly applied to the </P
><P 

>International Students Program (ISP) for a one-year student exchange and was accepted. Her </P
><P 

>parents were able to pay the price of the program which was 100,000 Yuan, or about U.S. $12,195. </P
><P 

>When Holly arrived at the Poole's, she had to struggle to speak the English language. Within 3 </P
><P 

>months she had become fairly fluent. By the end of her 10th month in the United States she was </P
><P 

>completely fluent in English. </P
><P 

>Holly graduated from middle school right before coming to America. So the school year </P
><P 

>(2001-2002) that she spent in the United States she would have been in the first year of high </P
><P 

>school in China. This year was equivalent to being a sophomore in the US school system. </P
><P 

>However, because of some complications at the school in Gloucester, VA, she was placed into the </P
><P 

>12th grade and has performed quite well. Holly hopes to be able to return to the United States for </P
><P 

>a college education after she finishes high school in China. Regarding her career, Holly would like </P
><P 

>to work in the Performing Arts. Her second choice is a career in Biology. </P
><P 
 align="center"
>Holly is a typical teenager with many interests. When asked about her hobbies and </P
><P 
 align="center"
>interests she said, &quot;I like roller-skating, ice skating, swimming, dancing, playing piano, reading, </P
><P 
 align="center"
>singing, listening to the music, talking to my friends, playing with the computer, playing basketball, </P
><P 

>bicycling, mountaineering, playing with animals (especially dogs), drama, performing, and bowling.&quot; </P
><P 

>In China, she &quot;... sometimes went to the temple of Buddhism with my grandmothers and my </P
><P 

>mother.&quot; </P
><P 

>Holly returned to China on June 10, 2002. She made many friends during her stay and </P
><P 

>quickly became part of the teenaged culture. She will be sorely missed. But on the bright side, we </P
><P

May I know Tyler's birth parents? &quot;Ty's birth name was Tyler Styron LaGasse. His birth mother passed away when he was 2. His birth father may still be alive but cannot have contact with Ty or know where he lives (so please don't try to contact him). However, Ty has a half-brother and Grandmother on his mother's side that we do keep in touch with. His brother is Matthew Styron. His grandmother is Vivian Styron (although I think her legal name may be Vincenza). Matthew is probably the better one to contact as Vivian is rather emotional about family (prone to exaggeration and misinformation??) and is also unwell (battling cancer that she likely won't survive). Let me know if you'd like Matt to email you. Tyler also has a half-sister and some cousins/aunts/and uncles that occasionally contact us. I don't know them very well, but Vivian or Matt could probably put you in touch with them.&quot; </P

><FONT color="#0000FF"><B><I>Photos in Album, Pages: 10,62,70,85-87,91,97,99,101,104,107,109,111,115,117,120,121 </I></P
><P 

><FONT color="#000000"></B>David Wolfe List and Carolyn Wilhemina Huffer List were born in Circleville, Ohio. David's parents were Luther and Dorothy E. Wolfe List, farmers in Pickaway County. Carolyn's parents were Roy and Margaret Huffer, plumbing and heating contractors in Circleville. David and Carolyn met at the skating rink just south of Circleville. Carolyn was skating with a friend when she caught David&rsquo;s eye. He approached her and asked her out on a date. When she rejected him the first time, David was persistent and asked again a week later, and Carolyn finally agreed. David&rsquo;s persistence paid off, and Carolyn and David married on 15 Jul 1956 at Trinity Lutheran Church in Circleville. </P
><P 

>David at 5&rsquo;-10&rdquo; with a medium build and Carolyn at 5&rsquo;-2&rdquo; with a petite build have been blessed with good health, being able to attend and participate in their children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren&rsquo;s events which have been the main focus of their lives. </P
><P 

>Carolyn attended Circleville High School while David attended Pickaway Township High School. Following David's graduation from The Ohio State University, college of engineering, they moved to Celina, Ohio in 1961 with two small children, David John and Ann Elizabeth List, where they continued to live for 53 years as of 2014. </P
><P 

>The family soon grew to three children by the birth of Brent Allen List. David John, Ann </P

><FONT size="+1"><B>Generation 2 (con't) </P

><FONT size="+1"></B>family grew by John, Elizabeth, and Brent Allen have collectively added ten grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren to the family. David and Carolyn and family are very blessed and thankful for their membership and involvement in the St. John Lutheran Church in Celina. Although two of their children converted to Catholicism because of their spouses, and seven out of ten grandchildren are now Catholic, the family remains closely bonded in both love and faith. Carolyn reared, nurtured and dearly loved the children, grand and great-grandchildren. Grandmother Carolyn&rsquo;s special love, Christmas and birthday gifts, as well as delicious home-cooked meals will always be remembered, being enjoyed by more than thirty people during the holiday season, although she insisted on making enough food to feed an entire Army. </P
><P 

>Carolyn worked at a local apparel shop when the children were small. Later she purchased the store where her daughter and daughters-in-law worked. An electrical fire in 1989 unfortunately ended the business. David started his career at New Idea Farm Equipment in Coldwater, Ohio as a design and development engineer. He was Product Planning Director for 25 years until the company was sold. He then worked for Pax Steel Products in Coldwater, Ohio, another farm equipment company, where he was Plant Manager for 20 years. </P
><P 

>David's favorite hobby was attending antique tractor shows and farm equipment shows with family members, especially grandchildren. A highlight event occurred when David and his brother Mark accompanied their Uncle Roger Wolfe to the OSU Farm Science Review near Columbus, Ohio when Roger was in his eighties. David's hobby of collecting and restoring antique farm tractors manufactured in the late 1940s and early 1950s has spanned over 40 years. The collection includes six Ford's (2N's, 8N's and Jubilee) and two John Deeres (#40 and #50). </P
><P 

>Grandfather David shared his love for antique tractors with his grandsons and granddaughters, taking them to farm equipment displays and shows. Grandmother Carolyn held numerous sleepovers in order for all of the grandchildren to spend time together. David and Carolyn ensured quality time with their grandchildren by having camp outs at Grand Lake Trailer Park, attending all of their sporting events, taking them to enjoy different animals on the farm, exploring the Indian Mound, making special trips to Circleville to see two sets of grandparents, going hiking at Old Man&rsquo;s Cave in Hocking County Hills, attending pumpkin shows, taking the majority of the grandkids to OSU football games, and accompanying all of the grandkids to Disney World. David showed his grandsons the beauty of volunteer work through St. Johns Builders doing habitat work such as building homes and ramps. David also assisted the grandchildren with school projects such as rockets and bottle launchers and showed off his green thumb by teaching them about flowers and gardening. </P
><P 

>Every grandchild knows that as long as they live, they will always be &ldquo;Grandpa/Grandma&rsquo;s boy&rdquo; or &ldquo;Grandpa/Grandma&rsquo;s girl&rdquo;, David and Carolyn&rsquo;s password not only to get each grandchild exactly what they wanted, but most importantly, the password to their heart. </P

The lovely farming couple just a few years out of school were rushed to start their family by the time-pressure of war. Even their place of marriage was dictated by the schedule of the war. </P
><P 
 align="justify"
>They managed a couple of happy years of married life before they were separated by George&rsquo;s deployment to Europe. They never saw each other again. George died of wounds suffered on the battle field; Josephine died shortly after child birth. Even the baby who was to be their first born was still-born. </P

><P 

>So far their search in central Ohio has been fruitless. </P
><P 

>Since Jan. 3, the wounded veteran has been at the Circleville home of his uncle and aunt, </P
><P 

>Mr. and Mrs. Frank Fischer. Intimating that his confinement would be prolonged, the Army granted </P

><P 

>Better facilities for his care were offered in town, so he was taken to his uncle's home. </P
><P 

>Another aunt, Miss Eva Fischer, is assistant to a Circleville doctor and has taught other members </P
><P 

>of the family how to make &ldquo;Bud&rdquo; comfortable. </P
><P 

>This past winter Miss Mary Fischer skipped the semester at Capital University where she </P

><P 

>S/Sgt. Fischer&rsquo;s infantry unit had been on the defensive at St. Lo two days and after things quieted down, they took the offensive last July 15. They were walking down a country road that afternoon when a sniper's bullet zoomed out of the hedgerow and struck him squarely in the neck. </P
><P 

>They took him to England and after an operation failed to relieve his condition he was sent to Scotland. On Sept. 21, they carried him off a hospital plane at Mitchell Field N.Y. and from a chaplain he learned that for him there would be no happy home-coming. The daughter born to his young wife on Aug. 31, his own 27th birthday did not live; Josephine Wolfe Fischer died the following day. After her death, Josephine lay in state in her father's living room on the farm. She held her dead baby girl in her arms. They were buried together. </P
><P 

>At home, &quot;Bud&quot; is receiving the same care he received at Percy Jones Hospital, Battle Creek, Mich, and at the Dayton Hospital ---penicillin, sulfa drugs and sedatives when the pain becomes too severe. </P
><P 

>His hospital-type bed, in the living room of his uncle's home is moved frequently to change his view from the window. There's a radio in the room for moments when he feels like listening. </P
><P 

>A reading stand fits over his chest and while he cannot turn the pages of magazines or books, there are always willing hands to do it for him. </P
><P 

>When he gets back to the farm -provided an adequate refrigerator can be found, he'll be able to watch the golden wheat swaying in the hot summer breeze and hear the sounds of life all around him. Then perhaps the days won't seem so long. </P

><P 

>Josephine Ann Wolfe Fischer (by niece Mary Jo McCall) </P
><P 

>Josephine (Aunt Jo) was the youngest daughter of the two girls in the Josephine and Earl Wolfe family. As a child I remember her being so very sweet and pretty and enjoying our family visits to the farm. I was four or five years old and I remember her playing with my pigtails as I sat next to her on the sofa. She had twin dolls which she had outgrown, and my cousin Dotty Jo and I played with the dolls when we stayed a few days with Grandma Wolfe on the farm in the summer. My sister Lois, six years older than I, also stayed on the farm sometimes in the summer. She remembers waiting for Aunt Jo to come home from her job at J C Penney's in Circleville each day. Lois and I each still have doll quilts that Aunt Jo sewed from samples of Penney's sample books. Aunt Jo and Lois liked being together, painting their fingernails and other &quot;girly&quot; things. They wrote letters to one another when Aunt Jo went to California. </P
><P 

>In 1942 Aunt Jo was engaged to marry Sgt. George Fischer. His army unit was sent to a base in California where Aunt Jo went by train for their wedding. They married 29 Mar 1942 and when George was sent overseas in May 1944 to St. Lo, France she returned to her parents' home on the Wolfe Road farm. She was pregnant and planned for her baby's birth and her husband's return. Her doctor was Dr. Lightner in Kingston. Uncle George was shot right after the invasion of Normandy, France and paralyzed from the neck down. Aunt Jo&rsquo;s baby died in childbirth at the end of August and Aunt Jo died a couple of days later on 1 September 1944. George died 11-months later in his home in Ohio on 25 July 1945. </P

><P 
 align="justify"
>The Dresbach family originated from Germany. The immigrant ancestors, Martin Dreisbach (1717-1799) and his son, Jacob Dresbach (1748-1804) were both born in Germany and settled in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania. Notice the change in the spelling of Martin&rsquo;s surname compared with that of his son and today&rsquo;s spelling in the title above. </P
><P 
 align="justify"
>Perhaps about 1800 the son of Jacob Dresbach (1748-1804), who was also named Martin Dresbach (1776-1850) moved to Hallsville in Ross County, Ohio. The year of 1800 is only a guess by the author based on the observation that in this period major relocations of progeny from developed farming areas was frequently due to only one heir inheriting a parent&rsquo;s farm and other siblings needing to move on to newly opened areas to establish their own farms. Descendants of this Dresbach family line can still be found in the Pickaway and Ross County areas today (December 2014). </P

><P 

>Jessie Rosealtha Dresbach was born on July 13, 1920 in Circleville, Ohio. As a high school student she enjoyed singing in school plays and choir. She met Roger Wolfe at her piano teacher&rsquo;s house after being introduced by another student, Roger&rsquo;s sister Josephine. She graduated class valedictorian and earned a partial scholarship to Capital University in Bexley, OH. She earned room and board by working as a housekeeper at a private residence. She graduated magna cum laude and earned a teaching certificate in elementary education. Jessie taught 5th grade at High Street School in Circleille, OH (1939-1941). She used her first year&rsquo;s earnings to repay a loan for her college tuition. Jessie became engaged to Roger in 1940. They married on June 21, 1941, and moved to a house in Columbus, OH on Elizabeth Ave. Jessie became a full-time homemaker with the birth of their first child, Suzanne Kay Wolfe, on June 2, 1942. When Roger moved to Denver with the Air Force, Jessie left Suzanne in the care of Warner and Myrtle Dresbach and followed him. The family home was rented out from 1943 to 1946. She worked as a salesperson at J.C. Penney in Denver, CO (1944). Jessie and Suzanne moved to Alamogordo, New Mexico for seven months in 1945 to be with Roger. Living in the apartment with the plumbing installed by her husband, Jessie had to haul 50 lb blocks of ice in a little cart since they didn&rsquo;t have a refrigerator. Jessie taught 3rd grade in Circleville, OH (1945-46). After Roger returned from Germany in June 1946, they were finally able to return to their home in Columbus. Their second child, Joyce Elaine Wolfe, was born on March 25, 1948. Suzanne recalled that her mother worked very hard to save money by sewing clothes for the family and preparing budget meals while her father was starting his first business. Vacations often included camping as a way to save money, too. Roger bought an old school bus and converted it into a camper. Roger and Jessie joined First English Lutheran Church about 1949. Jessie taught in the church nursery for 11 years. Jessie&rsquo;s life focused on raising her family until both daughters attended college. Her later years allowed her to pursue her passion for travel, a passion she shared with Roger. Jessie visited all 50 states in the U.S., 10 provinces in Canada, and 33 states in Mexico. Jessie and Roger were &ldquo;world travelers&rdquo; having visited 7 countries in South America; Egypt, 17 countries in Europe including Russia; Japan, China, Australia and New Zealand. Mostly Roger and Jessie traveled together, but Jessie went to Spain and Morocco with her sister Mabel and to England with her friend Shirley. Suzanne recalled that &ldquo;Jessie loved to plan trips. She enjoyed studying maps.&rdquo; Besides travel, her favorite activities were reading historical novels, dancing, singing, and dining out. Jessie died on September 14, 1993.

>My grandmother Jessie had a wonderful, beautiful, big smile. When she sang lullabies to me as a young child, her voice was soft and low. She always put the pickle dish next to my place at her dinner table, because she knew how much I liked them. I was lucky enough to grow up in the same city where she lived, so I spent many family occasions with her and grandfather. As a child, I often got to stay with them on weekends. She taught me how to play &ldquo;Crazy Eights&rdquo; (card game) and &ldquo;Scribbles&rdquo; (make pictures out of random scribbles). I remember she liked to read and solve crossword puzzles. One of my favorite things to do at my grandparent&rsquo;s house was to go down into the basement and see a slide show of their travels and listen to their stories. Grandmother liked to write letters and I enjoyed reading her messages from around the world. </P

She had a great imagination and I wish that I would have had more time with her in my adult years so that I could have seen the world through her eyes. I was always impressed that she had traveled all around the world and I tried to listen closely to stories about her many trips. Jessie made you feel special and loved her family. I never heard her raise her voice in anger, and I remember her strong empathy for the poor children that she met in her travels. I loved the games of Tripoly that we would play with red licorice in our drinks. I will always cherish the times I had with my Grandmother. </P

><P 

>Roger Wolfe was born May 1, 1920 at the farm originally purchased by his Great-Great Grandfather Phillip. His childhood was spent at working on a nearby farm purchased by his father Earl. After graduating from Jackson County High School, Roger drove solo across the country on Route 66 to Los Angeles, California to attend the Aero Industries Technical Institute (1939-1940) to start a career in the aircraft industry. He paid his tuition by playing basketball. After graduation, Roger took a job at an airplane plant in Buffalo, N.Y. (1940-1941) to be closer to his future bride Jessie. His work focused on control surfaces for the Navy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hell Diver&rdquo; bomber. When a new factory (Curtis Wright Co.) that built this plane opened in Columbus, Ohio, Roger was among the original 100 men from Buffalo who started the factory. He was promoted to General Foreman and worked at Curtis Wright from 1941-1944. He married Jessie in June 21, 1941. Their daughter Suzanne was born on June 2, 1943. Roger joined the Air Corp (U.S. Army Air Force) in 1944 and was assigned to the Alamogordo Air Force Base in New Mexico. While in Alamogordo, he taught himself plumbing so that he could get a home for his family on base. He recalled the whole family being awoken by a &ldquo;big bang&rdquo; which was rumored to be an explosion at an ammunition dump. Only later did he learn that the explosion they heard was the first atomic bomb test. He went to school in Denver, Colorado to learn how to service and maintain B-29 bombers (1944). While he was on emergency furlough due to the death of his sister Josephine, the rest of his unit deployed to the Pacific. Roger was sent to Europe for 6 months in Ferstenfeldbuk, Germany (1946). He chose to be a cook rather than take guard duty. After discharge from the military, he started building houses and doing remodeling. Daughter Joy was born March 25, 1948. With partner Paul Seymour, he formed the Columbus Home Maintenance Co. in 1954. Roger sold his share of Columbus Home Maintenance in 1960 and bought an interest in a plumbing business (J.A. Myers Co.). Roger worked for J.A. Myers from 1960 to 1980 and became Vice President. After retirement in 1980, Roger and Jessie focused their time on travel and family. They moved to Brooksville, FL from 1982-1984 where they enjoyed golfing and playing bridge, but later moved back to Columbus. They kept an apartment in Columbus but spent much of their time traveling in their RV. By the early 1990&rsquo;s they had traveled extensively in North America and Europe, and explored South America, Australia and Asia. The death of Jessie in September of 1993 was devastating for Roger after 51 years of marriage. He joined a senior center and met Garnet Joslin, a widow. Roger married Garnet on December 23, 1994. They shared interests in travel, golf and chess. Garnet convinced Roger to take up ballroom dancing. Declining health and blindness made life difficult for Roger in his final years. In 2004, </P

><U>Thoughts of My Dad by Joy Johnson from Roger Wolfe Memorial Service July 11, 2010 </U></P
><P 

>Growing up on Elizabeth Avenue in Columbus, I remember how handy Dad was with any projects. He showed me how to use an electric drill and power saw. Knowing how to hit a nail came in especially handy when he helped Larry and me add a deck to our house in Knoxville. He was a talker, but helpful even when we wired an unfinished basement. When I was around eight he built me very high wooden stilts to walk around on, no one else had anything like that. Dad worked long days and on week-ends, so my sister Suzanne and I especially liked our annual camping trips. No one else had a school bus camper to brag about. Throughout high school and eventually OSU, he chauffeured me to classes and was even cheerful at 6:30 am on the way to an early class. Larry and our girls, Elaine and Laura, have moved a lot but Jessie and Dad always traveled to see us and be part of our family. We shared many Christmases together, filled with laughter, games and looking at old family slides. </P

><U>Memories of Laura (Johnson) Cross &amp; Elaine (Johnson) Bell from Roger Wolfe Memorial Service July 11, 2010 </U></P
><P 

>Granddaddy always had a lap to sit on and a story to tell. He&rsquo;d clasp those long, lean fingers together, lean back in his rocking chair and share stories of his childhood, the war, and how things work. Grandfather loved to impart wisdom from his past. He was a very interesting man to talk to. We will miss his unique sense of humor. Sometimes it was subtle so you had to pay attention. Grandfather was highly mechanically-minded. It made me feel important that he cared enough to patiently explain how something was built, or how it worked. Grandfather loved to travel. He taught two generations of family to play chess. Granddaddy helped Elaine catch her first fish and helped her learn how to dribble a basketball downhill on our driveway in Tennessee. Granddaddy also helped Laura build an Erector Set wave machine for her Science Fair Project in middle school. On a trip to Michigan, Granddaddy went to an air show where he was proud to show us the B-29 Bomber that he had worked on in his early years. He taught us to treat everyone with respect, to look people in the eye and learn what you could from them, even if they were Michigan fans. He was strong, quiet when he needed to be, knowledgeable, quick to tease, and offer a smile. </P

>Grandfather&rsquo;s travel photographs and stories opened the world to me. He taught me that one key to a good life was to experience new places. Grandfather loved to make us laugh. He started stories with &ldquo;When I was a little girl...&rdquo; Every summer he mentioned the high &ldquo;humida-did-dity.&rdquo; Grandfather loved learning. He always wanted to know what I was studying in school -especially science. He asked me questions until I had to use an encyclopedia to find the answer. We learned together. Grandfather loved puzzles. He could stare at jigsaw puzzle pieces and pick out exactly the right one. </P

>Notes for Richard Ferriman Dresbach: </P
><P 

>Funny how often little, insignificant things in one's memory, get brought to the surface through genealogy research. Richard Dresbach is a case in point. When I (the author) was a boy living in the country about 3-miles east of Circleville, Ohio, Richard Ferriman Dresbach was a distant (1/4-mile) neighbor from my parents house. He had a farm that was located adjacent to the United Brethern Morris Church. While his farm was adjacent, his house was located about 1,000-yards from the church. This was the church that my brother, William Young Harrington, and I attended and in which Richard Dresbach was an important officer. Also going to the Morris Church, as we called it, was a school classmate of mine, Kathryn June Morris, far-and-away the smartest person in my class. Being a rural, agricultural community the houses were sparcely located on their 100-to-300 acre farms and Kathryn Morris' family drove several miles each Sunday to attend church. I mention the Kathryn Morris family because I was fortunate enough to enlist Kathryn in helping me recreate the memory of the Richard Dresbach family. </P
><P 

>Richard Dresbach's brother, Warner Lodge Dresbach, was the father of Jessie Rosaltha Dresbach who married Roger Earl Wolfe, the younger brother of Russell Franklin Wolfe (Lois Ann Wolfe's father). </P
><P 

>Richard Dresbach was a tall slim man with a big voice. He was a successful dairy farmer who owned a Holstein herd. Richard and his family were hard workers who in addition to maintaining their dairy herd, spent most of the summer making hay and raising corn to fill two large silos with ensilage for winter feed. He had 9-children, all a generation older than me. The family kept pretty much to themselves which made Richard's prominent role in the life of the church somewhat anomalous. Perhaps, however, it reflected his role within his own family. Living close to the Morris Church, Richard opened the church for Sunday morning services and looked after the comforts of the congregation by lighting the furnace in the winter and opening the windows on hot summer days. </P
><P 

>The Morris Church was initially a one-room structure typical of many small country churches built at the turn of the 20th century. It differed in that it was constructed of brick. It had a single large front door that entered into a vestibule that was nearly the width of the church building, except for a closet-style room on the left where the rope for the large church bell hung and could be rung by hand. There was also a coat-rack and a small cupboard that had been added to store church books, brochures, etc. But the most important role of this vestibule was that it was where the church segregated its congregation. Two doors led from the vestibule to the nave of the church. Inside the nave there was a center aisle that separated the bench-seating into two sections. Women and children sat on the left with the children at the front of this section. Men sat on the bench-seating on the right. There were only two exceptions to this seating arrangement. Immediately inside the nave, located between the two entrance doors and back against the wall of the two entrance doors, were two short bench-seats where the teenage boys sat. The other exception was a set of two or three bench-seats located on the right side of the chancel for the choir. </P
><P 

>Richard Dresbach was a pillar of the church. I don't know his title; perhaps the president or vice president. He had an active role in every church service: tending the board mounted on the chancel wall announcing the page-number of hymns for the service; selecting the pictures on a large easel for display at the appropriate service; reading the church business for a service-a-year-ago, and more. He always occupied the end seat on the far-right in the first row -it became recognized as his unofficial seat. During the sermon, Richard could always be counted on in spontaneity and volume to lead the congregational chorus of &quot;Amen.&quot; There was little doubt about his sincerity and willingness to lead. </P
><P 

>Richard Ferriman Dresbach was a good man who personified the strongly religious agragian families of the 19th and early 20th centuries in Ohio. </P

><FONT color="#000000"></B>Jessie Rosealtha Dresbach was the spouse of Roger Earl Wolfe. She is also the 1st cousin, once removed of Gediliah Alexander Dresbach. Gediliah A. Dresbach was the husband of Candice Kay Harrington and father of their children. </P
><P 

>Jessie Rosealtha Dresbach was born on July 13, 1920 in Circleville, Ohio. As a high school student she enjoyed singing in school plays and choir. She met Roger Wolfe at her piano teacher&rsquo;s house after being introduced by another student, Roger&rsquo;s sister Josephine. She graduated class valedictorian and earned a partial scholarship to Capital University in Bexley, OH. She earned room and board by working as a housekeeper at a private residence. She graduated magna cum laude and earned a teaching certificate in elementary education. Jessie taught 5th grade at High Street School in Circleille, OH (1939-1941). She used her first year&rsquo;s earnings to repay a loan for her college tuition. Jessie became engaged to Roger in 1940. They married on June 21, 1941, and moved to a house in Columbus, OH on Elizabeth Ave. Jessie became a full-time homemaker with the birth of their first child, Suzanne Kay Wolfe, on June 2, 1942. When Roger moved to Denver with the Air Force, Jessie left Suzanne in the care of Warner and Myrtle Dresbach and followed him. The family home was rented out from 1943 to 1946. She worked as a salesperson at J.C. Penney in Denver, CO (1944). Jessie and Suzanne moved to Alamogordo, New Mexico for seven months in 1945 to be with Roger. Living in the apartment with the plumbing installed by her husband, Jessie had to haul 50 lb blocks of ice in a little cart since they didn&rsquo;t have a refrigerator. Jessie taught 3rd grade in Circleville, OH (1945-46). After Roger returned from Germany in June 1946, they were finally able to return to their home in Columbus. Their second child, Joyce Elaine Wolfe, was born on March 25, 1948. Suzanne recalled that her mother worked very hard to save money by sewing clothes for the family and preparing budget meals while her father was starting his first business. Vacations often included camping as a way to save money, too. Roger bought an old school bus and converted it into a camper. Roger and Jessie joined First English Lutheran Church about 1949. Jessie taught in the church nursery for 11 years. Jessie&rsquo;s life focused on raising her family until both daughters attended college. Her later years allowed her to pursue her passion for travel, a passion she shared with Roger. Jessie visited all 50 states in the U.S., 10 provinces in Canada, and 33 states in Mexico. Jessie and Roger were &ldquo;world travelers&rdquo; having visited 7 countries in South America; Egypt, 17 countries in Europe including Russia; Japan, China, Australia and New Zealand. Mostly Roger and Jessie traveled together, but Jessie went to Spain and Morocco with her sister Mabel and to England with her friend Shirley. Suzanne recalled that &ldquo;Jessie loved to plan trips. She enjoyed studying maps.&rdquo; Besides travel, her favorite activities were reading historical novels, dancing, singing, and dining out. Jessie died on September 14, 1993.

>My grandmother Jessie had a wonderful, beautiful, big smile. When she sang lullabies to me as a young child, her voice was soft and low. She always put the pickle dish next to my place at her dinner table, because she knew how much I liked them. I was lucky enough to grow up in the same city where she lived, so I spent many family occasions with her and grandfather. As a child, I often got to stay with them on weekends. She taught me how to play &ldquo;Crazy Eights&rdquo; (card game) and &ldquo;Scribbles&rdquo; (make pictures out of random scribbles). I remember she liked to read and solve crossword puzzles. One of my favorite things to do at my grandparent&rsquo;s house was to go down into the basement and see a slide show of their travels and listen to their stories. Grandmother liked to write letters and I enjoyed reading her messages from around the world. </P

She had a great imagination and I wish that I would have had more time with her in my adult years so that I could have seen the world through her eyes. I was always impressed that she had traveled all around the world and I tried to listen closely to stories about her many trips. Jessie made you feel special and loved her family. I never heard her raise her voice in anger, and I remember her strong empathy for the poor children that she met in her travels. I loved the games of Tripoly that we would play with red licorice in our drinks. I will always cherish the times I had with my Grandmother. </P

>Roger Wolfe was born May 1, 1920 at the farm originally purchased by his Great-Great Grandfather Phillip. His childhood was spent at working on a nearby farm purchased by his father Earl. After graduating from Jackson County High School, Roger drove solo across the country on Route 66 to Los Angeles, California to attend the Aero Industries Technical Institute (1939-1940) to start a career in the aircraft industry. He paid his tuition by playing basketball. After graduation, Roger took a job at an airplane plant in Buffalo, N.Y. (1940-1941) to be closer to his future bride Jessie. His work focused on control surfaces for the Navy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hell Diver&rdquo; bomber. When a new factory (Curtis Wright Co.) that built this plane opened in Columbus, Ohio, Roger was among the original 100 men from Buffalo who started the factory. He was promoted to General Foreman and worked at Curtis Wright from 1941-1944. He married Jessie in June 21, 1941. Their daughter Suzanne was born on June 2, 1943. Roger joined the Air Corp (U.S. Army Air Force) in 1944 and was assigned to the Alamogordo Air Force Base in New Mexico. While in Alamogordo, he taught himself plumbing so that he could get a home for his family on base. He recalled the whole family being awoken by a &ldquo;big bang&rdquo; which was rumored to be an explosion at an ammunition dump. Only later did he learn that the explosion they heard was the first atomic bomb test. He went to school in Denver, Colorado to learn how to service and maintain B-29 bombers (1944). While he was on emergency furlough due to the death of his sister Josephine, the rest of his unit deployed to the Pacific. Roger was sent to Europe for 6 months in Ferstenfeldbuk, Germany (1946). He chose to be a cook rather than take guard duty. After discharge from the military, he started building houses and doing remodeling. Daughter Joy was born March 25, 1948. With partner Paul Seymour, he formed the Columbus Home Maintenance Co. in 1954. Roger sold his share of Columbus Home Maintenance in 1960 and bought an interest in a plumbing business (J.A. Myers Co.). Roger worked for J.A. Myers from 1960 to 1980 and became Vice President. After retirement in 1980, Roger and Jessie focused their time on travel and family. They moved to Brooksville, FL from 1982-1984 where they enjoyed golfing and playing bridge, but later moved back to Columbus. They kept an apartment in Columbus but spent much of their time traveling in their RV. By the early 1990&rsquo;s they had traveled extensively in North America and Europe, and explored South America, Australia and Asia. The death of Jessie in September of 1993 was devastating for Roger after 51 years of marriage. He </P

They shared interests in travel, golf and chess. Garnet convinced Roger to take up ballroom dancing. Declining health and blindness made life difficult for Roger in his final years. In 2004, Roger said &ldquo;I consider myself very fortunate to have lived during a period of development and most of all to have such a wonderful family...&rdquo; Roger died on July 6, 2010.

><U>Thoughts of My Dad by Joy Johnson from Roger Wolfe Memorial Service July 11, 2010 </U></P
><P 

>Growing up on Elizabeth Avenue in Columbus, I remember how handy Dad was with any projects. He showed me how to use an electric drill and power saw. Knowing how to hit a nail came in especially handy when he helped Larry and me add a deck to our house in Knoxville. He was a talker, but helpful even when we wired an unfinished basement. When I was around eight he built me very high wooden stilts to walk around on, no one else had anything like that. Dad worked long days and on week-ends, so my sister Suzanne and I especially liked our annual camping trips. No one else had a school bus camper to brag about. Throughout high school and eventually OSU, he chauffeured me to classes and was even cheerful at 6:30 am on the way to an early class. Larry and our girls, Elaine and Laura, have moved a lot but Jessie and Dad always traveled to see us and be part of our family. We shared many Christmases together, filled with laughter, games and looking at old family slides. </P

><U>Memories of Laura (Johnson) Cross &amp; Elaine (Johnson) Bell from Roger Wolfe Memorial Service July 11, 2010 </U></P
><P 

>Granddaddy always had a lap to sit on and a story to tell. He&rsquo;d clasp those long, lean fingers together, lean back in his rocking chair and share stories of his childhood, the war, and how things work. Grandfather loved to impart wisdom from his past. He was a very interesting man to talk to. We will miss his unique sense of humor. Sometimes it was subtle so you had to pay attention. Grandfather was highly mechanically-minded. It made me feel important that he cared enough to patiently explain how something was built, or how it worked. Grandfather loved to travel. He taught two generations of family to play chess. Granddaddy helped Elaine catch her first fish and helped her learn how to dribble a basketball downhill on our driveway in Tennessee. Granddaddy also helped Laura build an Erector Set wave machine for her Science Fair Project in middle school. On a trip to Michigan, Granddaddy went to an air show where he was proud to show us the B-29 Bomber that he had worked on in his early years. He taught us to treat everyone with respect, to look people in the eye and learn what you could from them, even if they were Michigan fans. He was strong, quiet when he needed to be, knowledgeable, quick to tease, and offer a smile. </P

>Grandfather&rsquo;s travel photographs and stories opened the world to me. He taught me that one key to a good life was to experience new places. Grandfather loved to make us laugh. He started stories with &ldquo;When I was a little girl...&rdquo; Every summer he mentioned the high &ldquo;humida-did-dity.&rdquo; Grandfather loved learning. He always wanted to know what I was studying in school -especially science. He asked me questions until I had to use an encyclopedia to find the answer. We learned together. Grandfather loved puzzles. He could stare at jigsaw puzzle pieces and pick out exactly the right one. </P

><FONT color="#000000"></B>Suzanne Kay Wolfe was born on June 2, 1943 in Columbus, Ohio to Jessie R. and Roger E. Wolfe. As a young girl she enjoyed visits to see her relatives in Circleville, OH, especially her grandmother Josephine Wolfe and her farm. She was a good student, but shy. She liked her pet rabbit and riding horses. She first met Dennis Mettle at First English Lutheran Church when they both were in high school, but didn&rsquo;t date him until her college years. She worked as a Kroger (grocery) check-out girl as a high school senior (1961). She earned a degree in education from Ohio State University (1964) and a teaching certificate for high school math and English. She married Dennis Mettle on October 23, 1964 in Columbus, OH. Suzanne taught junior high school mathematics from 1964 to 1968. She retired from classroom teaching to raise a family. Her first child, Renee, was born on January 2, 1969. A second daughter, Diane, was born on February 23, 1971. While being a full-time homemaker, Suzanne maintained her teaching certificate and became a private math tutor in the evenings. Suzanne developed an interest in genealogy, which became a life-long project. She became a volunteer librarian at the Franklin County Genealogical Society (FCGS) and co-wrote the &ldquo;Genealogical Researcher&rsquo;s Manual with special references for using the O.H.S. Library&rdquo; (1981). Eventually she began giving lectures at genealogical workshops and became an editor (1990-94) for &ldquo;The Franklintonian.&rdquo; Her interest in local history led her to independently research the history of Franklinton, OH. Suzanne retired from tutoring in 1989 after 16 years. Her interests included gardening, remodeling the family home, and reading historical fiction/romance novels. Suzanne died on July 11, 2012.

><P 

>My mother, Suzanne Wolfe, was exceptionally organized, loving, and always put family before herself. She had a logical mind that allowed her to succeed as a math teacher, but her true passion was for history. Her world centered on her home and family; she preferred privacy. When she did travel, she preferred the &ldquo;back route&rdquo; and places of historical interest. She was always busy, whether it was finishing chores, working on a genealogical or historical project or tending her garden. Her favorite indulgences were reading, Coke, and M&amp;M&rsquo;s. Her legacy includes two successful daughters and an amazing collection of family history. </P

>Aunt Suzanne was immensely creative in her organization techniques, and loved to create new landscapes in her yard. She found contentment in the little things, noticing the smallest details of a flower, or little chipmunk running by. I appreciate the passion she had for preserving our family&rsquo;s history and am happy that my children will be able to learn about their ancestors in &ldquo;living color&rdquo; as Suzanne had a talent for finding interesting stories about relatives. I remember Aunt Suzanne creating fun games to keep us younger cousins entertained and continued the tradition when I started to bring my children to visit her in Columbus, whether it be Christmas Bingo, or outdoor putt-putt tournaments. I loved to see Aunt Suzanne laugh, she was a very expressive, independent person who loved to research and find out everything there was to know about a topic of interest. Over the years she taught me a lot about gardening and I hope to pass that green thumb along to my children in her memory. </P

>Joyce Elaine Wolfe was born March 25, 1948 to Roger and Jessie Wolfe in Columbus, OH. She married Larry Alva Johnson on August 29, 1969 in Columbus, OH. Their first daughter, Elaine, was born on October 22, 1972, in New Kensington, Pennsylvania. Their second daughter, Laura, was born on February 12, 1976 in Knoxville, Tennessee. Joy and Larry have lived in Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Michigan, as well as Florida, where they now reside. Joy described her life this way: &ldquo;Larry and I, having lived in a variety of states, had the opportunity to have very interesting jobs. All my paid employment has been focused on a variety of ages. This has included seniors as a nursing home activity director in Michigan and Tennessee as well as working with preschoolers as a church preschool director in Ft. Myers, Florida. Elementary age children were my focus as a before-and-after school program director. I always enjoyed using a creative and fun approach to all my jobs. Every state we lived in had challenges, but usually new friends too. I'm a professional volunteer here in Florida over the last 19 years. I am grateful for my life and family. I am currently a puppet ministry director through church doing shows monthly for Head Start, a nursing home, and for our church preschool. I am glad to have started and given puppet materials to four locations in the states, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua. Hopefully I inherited my dad&rsquo;s sense of humor and mother&rsquo;s organizational skills. God has been good to me!!&rdquo; [Contributed by Joy Johnson, Sept. 2014] </P
