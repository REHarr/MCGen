four daughters of Jacob and Susan (Secris) Crow of Greene County, Pennsylvania
set out for a Sunday morning walk along Dunkard Creek. The area had been hit by
many Indian attacks over the past couple of decades, but those had abated
somewhat in recent months, giving settlers a fragile sense of security. The
Crow family were not strangers to tragedy. Indians had killed their son, John,
while he was on a hunting trip with his brothers on Fishing Creek in
present-day Wetzel County, West Virginia. The beauty of the May morning gave no
indication that tragedy was soon to strike the Crow family again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

girls, Lisbeth, Katherine, Susan and Christena, were walking to visit an
elderly couple that lived on Crabapple Run. When they were about a mile and a
half from home, they met their brother Michael, who had been sent to find a
horse that had strayed out of their pasture. Michael talked briefly to his
sisters and asked the youngest one, Christena, to return home with him, but she
wanted to continue walking with her sisters. Michael continued on his way home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

language. They thought if they all tried to break away, they could possibly
escape. The sisters were told to be quiet or be killed. Lisbeth, the oldest
sister, encouraged her sisters to pray and once again, their captors silenced
them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

questions about the forts, the number of settlers, and the settlements in the
area. Then a debate began between the Indians and Spicer. One was in favor of
killing the girls while another wanted to take them into captivity. Sadly, they
decided on the former. Susan was struck with a tomahawk and died instantly. It
is believed that Spicer killed Katherine. The third Indian was holding both
Lisbeth and Christena. When he swung his tomahawk at Lisbeth, Christena jerked
her arm and broke away. As she fled from the scene, one of the Indians threw a
tomahawk at her. It hit her in the back of the neck, momentarily stunning her.
She recovered and raced up the hill where she secreted herself in the bushes
before fleeing for home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

family immediately fled to the nearest fort and sent the alarm of the Indian
attack to their neighbors. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the party, a hunter named Enlow, found Lisbeth still alive by the creek. She
had been scalped and had crawled to the creek for water but was too weak to
return to the shade. He carried her down the road leading to her home where her
