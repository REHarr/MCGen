<p><b><span style='font-size:16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>WILLIAM R. DRUM</span></b><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'> -- was born on Muskingum
Creek, in Perry Township, Monroe County, Ohio, December 1, 1824. His father
came from Pennsylvania and settled on Captina Creek, Belmont County, the
country being a wilderness. From there he removed to Muskingum creek, this
county, and from there to William's present residence, in 1833. He took
letters-patent for his land, and William still holds the original title deed.
Jacob Drum, William's grandfather, served under General St. Clair in the war of
1812; he was at St. Clair's defeat on the Wabash, serving until the close of
the war, suffering many hardships. Phillip Drum, William's father, was born in
Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, October 7, 1799; he is deceased. His mother
was Mary (Kirkbride) Drum; they came to this county in 1808. Rebecca Stephens
became Mr. Drum's wife, March 12, 1885, in Monroe County. She was born in this
county, December 22, 1843; her parents are Jesse and Nancy (Jeffers) Stephens.
Mr. Drum was in the war of 1861, enlisting at Woodsfield, April 29, 1861, in
the 25th Ohio Volunteer Infantry; was in the battles of Cheat Mountain,
Chancellorsville. Bull Run, Slaughter Mountain, Cow Pasture Mountain, and
others. He was disabled at Camp Chase by striking his ankle against a piece of
timber when they were building the barracks, June 12, 1961. Served three years
and three months, and was discharged at Camp Chase, July 26, 1964. At
Gettysburg he was driving an ambulance, and, with others, got between the fire
of the contesting armies, and he was for some time in a very precarious
position. He is a farmer, carpenter and shoemaker. Address, Woodsfield, Monroe
county, Ohio.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
