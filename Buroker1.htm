were of German descent, and were among those who immigrated to America from the
Palatinates of Western Germany, in the 1700’s. These Germans settled mostly in
Eastern Pennsylvania, many around Bucks County. Beginning in the 1730’s,
through the 1790’s after the Revolutionary War, many German families migrated
to Western Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina and Georgia. The Burokers,
tradition has it, came to America about 1741. They settled in the Shenandoah
Valley in Page County of Western Virginia.</p>

who crossed the plains in 1864, enduring all the hardships and privations
incident to frontier life in any new country occurs the name of David Buroker.
Mr. Buroker was born in the Shenandoah Valley, Virginia, Dec. 17, 1818, and
although, now 75 years of age, bears his years in a wonderful manner being as
active and energetic as many who have not much more than reached the prime of

made the most of the opportunities afforded by the little schools of his county
attending when unpropitious weather interfered with farm work. In 1856, Mr.
Buroker removed to Missouri, remained there 3 years, then proceeded to [Davis
County] Iowa, where he remained until 1864, when he crossed the plains to
Washington Territory consuming 6 months in making the trip [April to September
1, 1864]. Being pleased with the country near Walla Walla, he located there on
rented land, which he farmed for one year. He then removed to Willamette valley
[Linn County, Oregon] where he remained 3 years on rented land. After this he
returned to Walla Walla, purchased on Mill Creek, 160 acres, which he afterward
sold and bought 240 acres which he subsequently disposed of and in this way
dealt in real estate until soon he was possessed of sufficient means to permit
the retaining of 500 acres of excellent land he now owns situated 7 miles
northeast of Walla Walla [one of these holdings was the George Evans Homestead
of 160 acres]. He also owns 120 acres near [the] city itself. So large is his
estate that 4 country roads and 2 railroads pass thru it, something that can be
said of no other farm in the State. Of course all this has made his property
exceedingly valuable.<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

is brief biographical sketch of Jonas Buroker, as published in “<i><u>The
History of Walla Walla County</u></i>” by Prof. W.D. Lyman, 1901. Jonas owned
three homesteads at that time. The certificates for two are still in the
family. One certificate was originally issued to George A. Evans, January 15,
1875, for 161.75 acres, and signed by U.S. Grant. The other was issued to Jonas
Buroker, February 10, 1881, for 120 acres, and signed by Rutherford B. Hayes.
The Bio reads as follows:</p>

12.0pt'>“<b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>J. BUROKER</b>, a farmer,
residing five and a half miles east of Walla Walla, was born in [Champaign
County] Ohio, January 18, 1845. He lived there until twelve years old, then
moved with the remainder of the family to Montgomery County, Missouri, whence
three years later, he went to [Davis County] Iowa. He was a resident of that
state until April, 1864, then set out across the plains with [ox] teams to
Walla Walla. He remained here from the time of his arrival [September 1, 1864]
until September, 1865, when he went to Linn county, Oregon, where the ensuing
three years passed. Returning then [1868/69] to this county, he took a
homestead and purchased a quarter section of land on Mill Creek, not far from
his present place of abode. In June, 1883, he bought the farm on which he now
lives. He is the owner of three hundred and seventy five acres of fine land,
and is engaged principally in producing [winter] wheat. An industrious,
progressive, enterprising man, he stands well in the community in which he
resides, though he does not seem to be specially ambitious for personal
preferment, or leadership among his confreres. He was married in Walla Walla
County, December 9, 1877, to Miss Josephine Patterson, also a pioneer of the
west, and they have one child, Claudia.”<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Claudia (also
know as “Becky”) related that the Vigilantes in Walla Walla had asked Jonas to
join them. This was during the late 1860’s and early 1870’s, at a time of
extensive lawlessness in the town and county, involving thievery, muggings,
cattle rustling, gambling, parlor and “bawdy” houses. Jonas abhorred these
activities, but refused to join. He felt that Law, order and justice should
prevail, which stance could have been construed as condemnation of the
Vigilantes methods. However, the Vigilantes never held Jonas’ non-involvement
attitude against him. Jonas may have leaned to the Quaker Teachings, one of
which was non-violence. He did not publicly support either side in the Civil
War, though a Republican. Jonas was known for his kindness and humanity. During
harvest, as one story goes, one Indian family, who lived near the “Ranch”, had
a habit of always arriving at noon time, just as dinner was being laid out for
the threshing crews. Jonas would always invite them to eat. Once, a couple of
the Hands objected to sitting at the same table with Indians. Jonas fired them
on the spot. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Over one part
of Jonas’ land, the “South Forty” as it was called, the old Nez Perce [<i>Indian</i>]
Trail crossed. This trail had been used by the Indian tribes for many
generations. Nothing would ever grow on that trail and can still be seen today.
Jonas never interfered with the Indians using that trail. He always made them
welcome on the Ranch. During periodic raids by the Indians, in the late 1800’s,
they never bothered his ranch, although they burned buildings and crops of his
neighbors. Jonas retired from farming in 1921, and moved to town. He died at
daughte Claudia’s home on Estrella Avenue, in Walla Walla, after a short
illness, January 21, 1924.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Jonas’s wife
was JOSEPHINE PATTERSON, born 13 September 1856, in Dubuque, Iowa. Her parents,
A.B. and Cynthia Ann (Page) Patterson, both natives of Ohio, moved to Iriquois
County, Illinois, in the early 1850’s, where two sons (Nathan A. and James)
were born, then to Dubuque in 1856. The Patterson family, with eight children,
arrived in Walla Walla in 1870. Family tradition records that they took the
train to San Francisco [<i>the Central Pacific and Union Pacific Railroads had
completed the</i> <i>transcontinental connection in May, 1869</i>]. They then
took a ship to Astoria, Oregon, and up the Columbia River, to near The Dalles,
then overland to Walla Walla. Josephine (also known as “Momma Josie”) often
recalled how seasick she was during the voyage from San Francisco. After Jonas’
death in 1924, Josephine purchased a house on Chestnut Street in Walla Walla,
where she lived until her death, February 17, 1943.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>CLAUDIA CECIL
BUROKER (25 Feb 1885/25 Feb 1957) married Oscar Baxter in 1901 or 1902, in
Walla Walla. She divorced him before World War I. Baxter died 13 July 1923. He
was one of 11 children born in Illinois, to Thomas Jefferson Baxter and Rosalia
Ambrosius (married 15 Feb 1866, in Illinois). Thomas J. Baxter had been in
Company C, Third Missouri Cavalry during the Civil War. </p>

and my grandfather, the oldest, drove an ox team and took his place with the

when the Burokers arrived, was a roaring mining and cattle town that had only
been in official existence for 5 years. It consisted of about 100 log and slab
buildings and tents, situated along, in, and astride a mud track, called “Nez
Perce Street”, later named “Main Street”, which ran southwesterly to the (New)
Fort Walla Walla Cantonment. The New Cantonment had been built in the winter of
1857/58 to replace old Fort Walla Walla that had been burned down by Indians in
the Indian Wars of 1853-55. The old Fort had been at the juncture of the
Columbia and Walla Walla Rivers near Wallula.</p>

gold in 1860 on the Clearwater River in Idaho Territory and the “Rush” to that

gold near Boise in the late fall of 1862, temporarily slowed progress in Walla
Walla, until another discovery was made in the Kootenai area near the
headwaters of the Columbia River. This produced another rush in the spring of
1865. In 1864, it had been discovered that the uplands around Walla Walla would
produce high yields of winter wheat. One report was 33 bushels to the acre.
There was a drought in 1864/65, but it is not known if this led the Burokers to
their decision to go to Linn County. They had rented land in<span

and homesteaded. The land they homesteaded on Mill Creek never yielded less

character and incident than the time when the Vigilantes were in their glory.
Like every other city of the northwest in those days, Walla Walla had its quota
of gamblers, thieves, and general toughs. The courts soon became powerless to
cope with the evil doers. There were regular gangs of cattle thieves organized,
who would operate much in this manner: some one of the gang would start a bunch
of cattle away to a certain point, where another lay in wait, who would drive
them on to still another relay, and so they would keep them in motion until
they were clear out of the country. It became almost impossible to run down the
thieves, and when caught, there were so many of their own number to witness in
their favor that it was next to impossible to secure conviction. In 1864 and
1865 the Vigilantes organized, then came a reign of terror to the evil doer. It
suddenly seemed as though nature had granted trees a new and startling fruit,
for it became a very common thing to see dead men’s bodies dangling from limbs.
In one month during the busy season thirty-two men were reported as having been
mysteriously hanged. The common expression as men met on the streets on a
morning was, “Well, whom have we for breakfast this morning?” And it was a rare
thing when some unfortunate’s name was not served up for discussion as having
suffered the vengeance of the dread society. There was no escaping its clutches
when once it wet its seal upon a man. As one old-timer expresses it, “There was
only one way to get out of their hands, when once they had started for you, and
that was to literally fly”.”<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
