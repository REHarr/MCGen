<CENTER><H2>SURNAME FILE FORM -- SEARCHING FOR INFORMATION ON<BR>ANCESTORS AND DESCENDANTS OF MONROE COUNTY RESIDENTS</H2><BR></CENTER>
The Monroe County Chapter of the Ohio Genealogical Society (MCC of OGS) maintains a <B>Surname File</B> in which<BR>
members and non-members may submit surnames of the families of former and current residents of Monroe County, Ohio.<BR>
Surnames submitted to the Surname File are published in the MCC of OGS newsletter, <B><I>The Navigator,</B></I> as they are received.<BR>
The historical Surname File is currently available as a card file in the MCC of OGS Reading Room located in the Monroe<BR>
County Regional Library at the intersection of State Route 78 (east of the center of town) and Home Avenue.  The Surname<BR>
card file is currently being computerized and will be placed on this web site in the near future.  This is an excellent way<BR>
to locate others who may be searching for the same ancestral lines.  Many relatives have been located through this service.<BR>
You are invited and encouraged to submit your list of surnames.  Who knows whom you might meet this way?<BR><BR>
Submit as many surnames as you like, but, PLEASE SUBMIT ONLY <B><U>ONE</U> SURNAME</B> ON EACH ON-LINE FORM.
