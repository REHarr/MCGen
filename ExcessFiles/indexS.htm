</B></U><P>Monroe County, Ohio is truly one of the jewels among the counties of our nation. As truly one of the frontier counties as the nation expanded westward, Monroe County was witness to fierce struggle between the Native Americans and encroaching settlers. Stories abound from this period that would challenge our best movie industry for action, heroism, defeat, courage and progress. The County saw an oil boom that changed the culture of its people forever. In this section several of the important stories, events and informational sources are included. They help set the stage for the periods in Monroe County history in which our ancestors lived. Some are just intertaining.</P>
