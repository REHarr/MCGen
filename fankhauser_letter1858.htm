<p class=MsoBodyText3>The following is a translation of a letter written by
Niklaus Fankhauser, early immigrant and settler in Monroe County, Ohio.<span

following is an excerpt from a letter written by Niklaus Fankhauser March 19,
1852 to be sent to his friends in Switzerland. The letter gives good insight
into the lives of the Fankhausers. The letter may also be valuable to
researchers because it gives times, dates, places, and names. The letter was
donated to the Monroe County Historical Society by Mr. Ernest Thode who
translated it from the German language into the English language.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman";text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>.................We
are also especially happy that you asked about the whole F(r)ankhauser family,
namely who was still around. There is nobody left but me. They have all went
over to join their forefathers as good, believing Swiss. Johannes (John) died
on 1 May 1847 of pneumonia; he was not sick for more than ten days. My daughter
was at his place for a visit; he sat in front of his house short of breath,
came into the parlor, gave her, as well as his children, his hand, and lay down
on his bed with closed hands and died without their noticing immediately.
Daniel died on 30 March 1850; he was sick with consumption for 11 months. His
survivors had a beautiful gravestone made for him. The funeral party was so
large that there was not room for everybody in the church. Samuel died of
pulmonary edema in August 1851 after being sick for 3 months. He lived in Weinsberg
(Winesburg), (Ohio), 109 miles from here. (It appears that this brother was not
included in the history, The Fankhausers of Monroe County because he had
settled in another county) We hadn't seen one another for 32 years, and since
he perceived that his end was coming, he let me know with the desire that I
visit him yet. Consequently, I paid him a visit and we discussed the one
necessary thing, namely the work of salvation of Jesus Christ and the
afterlife. The comforting statements that I was able to give him by the help of
God moved him to think so much of me that I had to say to him: &quot;Dear
brother, your brother Claus (Niklaus) is also a poor old sinner, but thank God,
a sinner who must dip and absorb grace upon grace from the same well that he is
showing to you.&quot; We broke out in many tears. Five minutes before his
demise he still sang, &quot;Jesus accepts the sinner.&quot; Like my other
brother, he recommended his wife and children to me with regard to religion,
for here one must know what he believes; otherwise one is susceptible to
fanaticism, and there are diverse kinds of that here..................<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman";text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>As for
churches and schools, we are quite properly set up here. So far we have had the
good fortune that our children have been quite well schooled. They learn German
and English but are instructed and confirmed in the German language. We used to
have clergy that preached nice enough, but could not tell anybody how to be
saved, so that they were unable to counsel the sick, the downtrodden, and the
depressed, and so it frequently happened that I was called to them, which I was
sincerely glad to do at any time, as far as time and circumstances allowed. Now
it is different. The dear Lord was gracious to us and sent Jakob Baumberger
(Note: of Koppigen, Canton Aargau, Switzerland) formerly an evangelist for the
Evangelical Society in Bern. When I heard him for the first time and heard from
him, &quot;How do you get right with God?,&quot; and then heard the explanation
of how to be justified, I had to break out in tears. Now the worship service is
so well attended that we must build a new church. The people come from eight or
nine miles away to attend services. The new church is to be built of bricks,
which have been fired. This summer it should be opened and dedicated, if God
wills it. ................<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman";text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>As for
the F(r)ankhauser family here, there are so many of us that people say there
must an Abraham among us. I am the father of 21 children and 43 grandchildren;
Daniel, of 14 children and 18 grandchildren; Johannes (John), of 14 children
and 15 grandchildren. The children and grandchildren of us three brothers who
are still alive come to 113 souls, and, thank God, are all healthy and well.
There is nobody sickly among them or with physical handicaps. All grew up well
and there are many tall men and women among us. It is a pleasure for me and my
wife, when we visit our children and grandchildren, how friendly we are
accepted, then surrounded by 6 or 8 grandchildren who know how to tell us a lot
of news in order to receive the nice gift.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

property consists of 80 acres of land. But the acre (ca. 4,049 square meters)
amounts to somewhat more than your Juchart (ca. 3,597 square meters). Of these
80 acres, 60 are arable, on which there is also an orchard laid out containing 100
fruit trees, which as a rule are very fruitful, and annually yield their
various fruits. Since I have lived here, I know of only one time when the fruit
failed. My cattle consist of 14 beef cattle, 2 horses, and 15 sheep. Last
winter was a very cold one, such that the oldest settlers couldn't remember any
like it. On the other hand, last summer was exceptionally dry, but there was a
want of nothing except water. One can say there is no deficiency here;
everything can be sold at a good price, and so I live here happily. My two
young boys help me do the field work. Mother occupies herself with spinning and
other household chores, and the daughters do what is in their line. When my
day's work is ended and I get ready to go to bed, I first take up the Bible,
which simultaneously reminds me both of a poor sinner and of Him who does not
want man to be lost.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman";text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>28
years ago, when I was still new in the country, I made a trip in the state of
Ohio, where I made a walking tour of over 400 miles. I made this journey without
cash. In this region there lived a man who was a turner and made me some small
wooden pipes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I took these in my
rucksack and started my journey on these uncleared paths. So I came from place
to place and was able to pay my lodging with tobacco pipes, especially in those
days when women smoked tobacco and pipes were accepted as money. Because I was
Swiss, I was welcome in many places and met people who were able to tell me
many good new things about Switzerland. The places in those days had a good and
fine name, but were quite small; the largest that I found were hardly as large
as Aarberg (Canton Bern, Switzerland) and Nidau (Canton Bern, Switzerland). In
most of the places there was a smithy, a general store , and an inn, and
between the places were woods, so that I often had to travel three or four
miles before coming to another cabin. They told me about the city of Berlin
(Ohio); now I thought, there must be something good there, and when I thought I
was getting close to it according to the reports, I met somebody and asked him
how far it was to Berlin. To my astonishment he said that I had passed it two
miles back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman";text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>When I
visited my brother last summer, I came back through many of the same places
where I had been on the first trip. But how different it looks now! Forests
have been transformed into fields; the small places are metamorphosed into
large cities; the log cabins are mostly razed and in their places two to three
story houses made of brick. In many of the cities there are three or four and
more streets that are paved with stone. If someone approaches one of these
cities, he can already see the activity in various trades from afar through the
pillars of coal smoke climbing skyward; there are all kinds of ironworks,
glassworks, stone mills, stone sawmills, spinning machines, and all sorts of
factories to make clothing goods, and in many of these cities there are three
or four churches already, and although of different denominations, for the most
part they honor Him who purchased us with His blood and reconciled us with God.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

friend! My dear friend! I have terrible pain for my dear old fatherland, since
I see in my old days how deeply it has sunk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>I left my dear home town (Bern) in '19 on Easter Monday (12 April 1819)
with many handshakes and wishes of God's blessing from my old lords and the
fathers of the land. I went past the Schuetzenmatte (shooting meadow in Bern)
to Bueren (probably Bueren and der Aare, Canton Bern, where the TISHER<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>migration party could take a flatboat,
rather than Bueren zum Hof, Canton, Bern, Jacob TISHER (Tuescher)'s previous
residence). I had eight small children and the great ocean before me. It was as
if somebody was hunting me; my fear was so great that I didn't want to eat or
drink. In those days all was peace and celebration. Everybody lived in his
cabin. ............<o:p></o:p></span></p>
