<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>The Monroe County Chapter of the Ohio
Genealogical Society (MCC of OGS) is a very busy and exciting place! And, we
love it!! We would like to be even busier because the more that we can
accomplish the more resources will be available for our members and visitors.
We need your help!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>One of the major benefits of being a member
of MCC of OGS is that by working together we can accomplish so much more than
as individual researchers. Everyone benefits. Just imagine how little progress
would be made if we each had to do ALL of the basic research to construct our family
trees. But, with each of us pooling the information we find and sharing such
efforts as compiling facts, taking inventory of cemeteries local to us,
compiling surname lists, sharing family tree documents, and such, our search is
much easier and a lot more fun. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>All of these tasks can be a lot of fun;
particularly, when we work together. Almost any of us can choose the area we
would like to play in and the way we go about it. Some of us like to work in
groups -- some prefer to work separately. There is something for everyone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>You do not need a computer to help. For some
jobs it is a big help; for others it is not. But, for much of he original
research it is not necessary. Also, you do not have to live in Monroe County to
participate. You do not even have to live in the USA. Many of the projects can
be done anywhere -- many without ever leaving your own home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>In the list below, several activities have
been identified and the kinds of help needed is discussed. If you see something
that you can do or that particularly interests you, please volunteer. At the
moment we have a lot of things that we are trying to accomplish and very few
volunteers to make them happen. Really, it is a lot of fun and EVERYONE can
help. Please look over the list below and pick one or several things that you
would like to do. Give Karen Romick a call at (phone: </span><b><span

send her an e-mail at <strong><a href="E-mailAddresses.htm">Karen Romick</a></strong>.
Tell her what you would like to work on and how you would like to help. Karen
would love to work with you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>One more thing -- the project that you are
interested in doing or the thing that needs to be done may not be on the list
below. If you think of something that should be done and that would contribute
to the body of information and tools of the Chapter, suggest it. Just remember
that you may be the best qualified to define the specific project that you wish
to undertake. This is particularly true when it comes to the things you know
best -- your own family; the history of the area where you live; the cemeteries
near your home; and the things that relate to your work. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Go ahead! Take the plunge -- contact Karen.
You will not regret it. Karen can tell you if a new project has been done
before or if there are others who would like to work in a particular area. She
can also suggest ways in which your assistance can be applied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>One point should be made before you start
looking through the several interesting projects below. In almost all of the
activities, Karen Romick is identified as the first contact point that you
should make. Obviously, Karen can not manage so many projects by herself. But,
as the MCC of OGS president, she is in the best position to put you in contact
with someone knowledgeable of the project. Also, if there is no lead person for
the project and you would be interested in being that person, please let Karen
know. You will probably get the job.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Below is a list of activities that are in
need of your help. Please look them over and choose one or more to work on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Monroe County Fair during the month of August. We will be handing out
literature and also selling our publications. We are in need of volunteers who
will be willing to operate the booth. If you can help out for an afternoon, an
evening or a day, please let us know. Call Karen at 740-483-1481 or e-mail </a></span><span

is a need to prepare a computerized inventory of the contents of the MCC of OGS
library or Research Room. The contents of the Research Room has already been
inventoried and the resulting card catalog has been maintained up-to-date. The
task of converting this card catalog to a computerized inventory involves
typing the names of all of the books and documents that are there onto a
computer disk. The task can be interrupted as necessary and completed as time
may be available.</span></p>

<p><a name=invCem><b><u><span style='font-size:13.5pt;color:maroon'>Inventory a
Cemetery</span></u></b></a><span style='mso-bookmark:invCem'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt'> </span></span><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>-- One
of the important long term projects that the MCC of OGS has underway is the
location and inventory of all of the cemeteries in Monroe County. At present
220 private and public cemeteries have been identified. Perhaps 60% of these
have been inventoried to date and about 30% have been published. Publication is
proceeding and the rate of publication is currently controlled by the funds
available. This task of inventorying cemeteries is an opportunity to get
outdoors and enjoy the season while doing a very important job of preparing an
inventory of the cemetery monuments. The task requires visiting the cemetery of
your choice (coordinate with Karen Romick to avoid duplicating the work of
someone else) with a notebook and pen and recording the names, dates and any
other pertinent information from each monument. The name of the cemetery and
good directions for reaching it is also needed. The resulting list needs to be
eventually typed onto a computer by either the person making the inventory or
at a later date by someone else. Eventually, the results will be published and
credit given to the participants who implemented the task. There is
considerable experience within the Chapter with the best ways of conducting
this task, so contact Karen Romick to schedule a cemetery and to get any
assistance that might be available.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

MCC of OGS has constructed and sponsors a major Internet web site as one of its
principle methods of communication with the members and the public in general.
This site can be accessed at: <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~ohmccogs/">http://www.rootsweb.com/~ohmccogs/</a>
. While the business of the MCC of OGS is fairly stable, from time-to-time
there is a need to change things that appear on the site. Changes of such
things as the current news items, meeting schedules, status of certain
projects, new items to be added and updated, etc. needs to be made
periodically. The task is primarily that of the webmaster for the site. This is
a fun job that does not require a computer jock to do. Some general knowledge
about the workings of a computer and a little experience with web sites are all
that is needed. Contact Karen Romick if you are interested in assisting with this
task.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><a name=presChRec><b><u><span style='font-size:13.5pt;color:maroon'>Preserving
Church Records in Monroe County Churches</span></u></b></a><span
style='mso-bookmark:presChRec'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'> </span></span><span
style='font-size:13.5pt'>-- Church records have been one of the major sources
of genealogical information over the centuries. The records of three German
that spanned the period between 1831 and 1948 that were translated by Dr.
Shirley Harmon and published in 2000 under the title</span>, <span

Evangelical Protestant Churches&quot;</span><span style='font-family:Tahoma'> </span><span
style='font-size:13.5pt'>are examples of the potential value of such records.
The MCC of OGS has initiated a long term project to try to locate and preserve
as many such records as possible. This is a project that is in need of a lead
person to help develop a plan for the effort. It is also an opportunity for
several volunteers who would work with the churches to locate and preserve
records in a way that meets the needs of the church and the project. Volunteers
may wish to limit their effort to only their own church or may choose to
operate on a wider basis. This could be an unusually exciting project with many
rewarding outcomes. Contact Karen Romick if this activity appeals to you at any
level.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><a name=compBDM><b><u><span style='font-size:13.5pt;color:maroon'>Monroe
County Births, Deaths, Marriages, and Other Key Records</span></u></b></a><span
style='mso-bookmark:compBDM'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'> </span></span><span
style='font-size:13.5pt'>-- One of the most arduous tasks in genealogy research
is that of plowing through a maze of Probate Court and Health Department
records in search of that specific ancestor or family line. It can be fun and
exciting but it is labor intensive and frequently uncertain. A slight loss of
concentration can cause an oversight of an important record or entry. Yet this
process is repeated many times each year as new researchers trod the same path,
looking through the same records and making the same mistakes as hundreds of others
before them. One of the major impacts of the records being searched by so many
people is the unfortunate damage and destruction to the documents themselves.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>This is a task ideally suited for the
computer. Once the records are placed into the computer memory, highly accurate
searches can be done in a matter of a few seconds. Because of the ability of
the computer to find accurately locate all entries, the search is much more
conducive to discovering siblings, aunts, uncles, and all sorts of kin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>The MCC of OGS has undertaken several
projects designed to computerize some of the most important Monroe County data
to the genealogy community. These include records of birth, death and marriage
in Monroe County, Ohio. About 50 years of marriage records have also been
privately transcribed and published by Wes Cochran. Much more help in this area
is needed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>This is one of those projects that can be
worked on as time is available. Further, since most of these records are also
available on microfilm, any volunteer with access to an LDS Family Research
Centers can participate. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>One of the interesting things about this task
is that as the information is typed, the volunteer is treated to an impressive
exposure to information that generates surprising insight about the people and
places of the time. It is almost like being able to step back into time and
witness many of the people and relationships of the day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>If you can spare a few hours a month (more or
less) and would like to help with one of these important projects, please
contact Karen Romick. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><a name=compSur><b><u><span style='font-size:13.5pt;color:maroon'>Computerize
&quot;Surname File</span></u></b></a><b><u><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
color:maroon'>&quot;</span></u></b><span style='font-size:13.5pt'> -- One of
the big successes of the MCC of OGS has been the ever-growing surname file.
Members and non-members can submit surnames for which they are doing research.
People searching for common surnames may be able to exchange information of
value to both searchers. In many cases the searchers are related and it becomes
a useful way to discover relatives they never knew they had.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>At present there are two somewhat limited
ways to access these surname files. One is to come to the MCC of OGS Research
Room and physically search through the files. The other is to happen to see the
surname in an issue of the MCC of OGS newsletter, the <b><i>Navigator</i></b>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>One of the projects of the MCC of OGS is the
computerize the Surname File so that it can be computer searched. This will not
only make the information more widely available, it will allow for comparisons
to be made among the surnames and searchers so that it will be easier to find
potential relatives and sources of genealogical information.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Since the Surname File cards already have the
information in written form, the primary task it to transfer the information to
a computer disk. This is one of those tasks that can be divided among several
people. If you have almost any kind of computer and could type data from the
cards to a computer disk, please contact Karen Romick and arrange to help with
this important project.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><a name=typing><b><u><span style='font-size:13.5pt;color:maroon'>Typing

style='mso-bookmark:typing'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'> </span></span><span
style='font-size:13.5pt'>-- You will have noticed in the above projects that many
may be originally recorded as hand-written information. For some projects such
as the 'Cemetery Inventory&quot; projects, it is almost essential that the
original data be gathered as hand-written material. To convert these
hand-written notes and data into publishable format it is essential that it be
typed onto computer disks. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>If you have a compute and a little time to
devote, your help is urgently needed to help with the important task of
converting material to computer media. Please contact Karen Romick and
volunteer your support.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><a name=lookups><b><u><span style='font-size:13.5pt;color:maroon'>Look Ups</span></u></b></a><span
style='mso-bookmark:lookups'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'> </span></span><span
style='font-size:13.5pt'>-- One of the services that the MCC of OGS tries to
provide is to respond to requests for information by people who are remotely
located from the source of information or otherwise are not able to access it.
As the expert source of Monroe County, Ohio genealogy, requests are frequently
received that requires that someone be able to go to appropriate records for
the answers. This labor-of-love is very rewarding in terms of friends made and
the opportunities to help people otherwise unable to progress in their quest
for their lineage. Queries vary widely from requests from information from
records to looking for a grave in a specific cemetery.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>While most of the look-up requests that the
Chapter receives are likely to be for information in the Monroe County area,
sometimes requests come in for information that is available only from places
remote from Monroe County. An example might be a request for a look-up at a
location in Missouri for information about a Monroe County family that moved to
Missouri a century ago. The point is that you can be a look-up even though you
may live in an area that is quite remote from Monroe County. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>If you would be willing to be included on a
list of possible 'Look Ups' please let Karen Romick know. The Look-up list is
not published but is kept by the Chapter as a resource list. Being included on
such a list does not commit you to perform look-ups that you may not wish to
do. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
