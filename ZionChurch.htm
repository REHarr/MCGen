&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1860, George Richner (1833-February 1, 1915) erected a
large frame farmhouse for George and Elizabeth (Coates) Bracy. It stands today
and out a lane a short distance east of Mt. Zion Church building. George
Richner was the son of Claudius, Sr., (born 1782) and Margaret (ca.
1793-November 22, 1874). Born in Bavaria (Germany), Claudius hired out on a
whaling vessel to earn passage fare to America. He departed Lancaster County,
Pennsylvania, about 1810, and settled land near the junction of standing Stone
Run and Sunfish Creek. Claudius, Sr., and Margaret were buried in the Bracy-Mt.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About 1891, services were discontinued at Bracy. The
building was unoccupied for years and it deteriorated to the extent that, when
interest in holding services at the location was revived, it was razed and a
new building erected on the site. Evangelist McVey spoke on a Sunday, in 1903,
when the new building was dedicated by the newly organized Mt. Zion Church of
Christ members. Western Taylor was laid to rest in the cemetery the year of the
dedication. Wes (1845-1903) married Catharine Bracy (1850-1894) daughter to
