The Spirit of Democracy Issue:&nbsp; Woodsfield, Ohio, December 3, 1931<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John W. Crawford, son of the late Mr. and Mrs. Thomas
Crawford, was born near Woodsfield, Ohio on May 13, 1866 and departed this life
at his home in Woodsfield on November 26, 1931, at the age of 65 years, 6
months and 17 days. He was a son&nbsp; of Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Crawford, the
former coming to this country at an early age from Derry County Ireland. His
mother     s maiden name was Miss Mary Cooper. To their happy union, six children
were born, one son Hugh having preceded his brother John to the better
land.&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
brothers and sisters surviving are James Crawford, of Estherville, Iowa; Mrs.
Lydia Bothwell, of Formoso, Kansas; Dave G. Crawford and Mrs. William McCue of
the home. Two nieces and four nephews also mourn the loss of their beloved
uncle.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Crawford grew to manhood on the farm and during the past
several years was associated with his brother Dave in the firm of Crawford
Bros., dealers in lumber and timber.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Crawford never married and made his home with his
brother and sister after death of his parents. He was industrious and honorable
in his relations with fellowmen and though retiring in disposition those who knew
best respected him most.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At an early age, Mr. Crawford became a member of the
Presbyterian Church Body and was always faithful in his attendance and other
duties therein. At any time and in any way and at any place where service was
needed in his neighborhood, Mr. Crawford was always ready to go and do anything
within his power.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Crawford was seriously ill only a few weeks, from
stomach and intestinal complications and everything possible was done to
restore his health, not only but his loved ones, but by the best of medical
skill and service. He bore his suffering patiently and with a confidence born
of rectitude and faith, his spirit returned to Him who gave it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>                         </span>Injuries sustained in an automobile
crash Saturday evening proved fatal to John W. Jackson, 30, of Holliday's Cove,
W.Va. He died Sunday morning at 5:25 o'clock. Death occurred at The Wheeling
Hospital where he was rushed following the mishap.<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>                         </span>Jackson, accompanied by George
Wells. 21, of Stubenville, was driving north on Warwood Avenue, Wheeling.&nbsp;
At North Twenty-third Street, he is thought to have failed to make the curve
and crashed into Glenn's Run.<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>                         </span>The automobile, according to
witnesses, was traveling at a high rate of speed. The machine jumped over a six
foot embankment and plunged into the run. Jackson and Wells were thrown clear
of the auto, which alighted on its top.<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>                         </span>Both men were rushed to the
hospital. An examination revealed Jackson was critically injured, while Wells
escaped with a few slight cuts and bruises. A post mortem, performed Sunday
afternoon, revealed that death had been caused by an internal hemorrhage,
resulting from a fractured ribs cutting the lungs.<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>                         </span>Jackson was very well known. He was
a foreman in the mills of Weirton Steel Company. He is survived by a wife and
four children. The body has been removed to the home of his parents, Mr. and
Mrs. B.S. Jackson, of Graysville. Funeral services were held Tuesday at The
Woodsfield Church of Christ, in charge of Minister J. V. A.&nbsp; Traylor.
Interment in Oaklawn Cemetery. Both grief-stricken families have the sympathy
of many friends.</span><span style='font-size:14.0pt'> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

The Spirit of Democracy Issue:&nbsp; Woodsfield, Ohio, April 1931<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Sophia Pfalzgraf, nee Kilburn was born in Greenup
County, Kentucky, September 11, 1859, the daughter of John Henry and Maria
Sophia Linga Kilburn and passed on to her reward on April 7, 1931, at the age
of 71 years, 6 months and 25 days.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She came to Monroe County, Ohio, at the age of 7 years. She
was united in marriage November 18, 1880 to George Pfalzgraf and to this union
were born six children. Two children preceded her in death, Matilda, at the age
of ten months, and Anna, about 12 years ago. She leaves to mourn her loss, her
husband and four children: Mrs. Louisa Kahrig, Mrs. Pauline Bintz and Mrs.
Minnie Bintz, all of Lewisville, Route 1, and Benjamin of the home; nineteen
grandchildren; four great grandchildren; two brothers, Henry and Gus Kilburn,
of Lewisville, and one sister Lucetta, of Woodsfield; besides many other
relatives and friends. None knew her but to love her, nor named her but to
praise her.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her greatest delight was in making the home beautiful for
her husband and children. During her illness she was patient and kind to all
who ministered unto her, having a sweet and heavenly smile on her face to the
last. She has gone to rest. She can never return to us, but we can go to her.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was confirmed at the Middle Church at the age of
fourteen years and was a consistent member of this Church for over fifty years.
Her burial was made in the St. John     s Middle Church cemetery.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Fraternally, he was a member of the Beallsville Masonic Lodge, the Jerusalem
K.of P. Lodge and of the Woodsfield I.O.O.F. Lodge. He was also one of the
directors of the First National Bank of Woodsfield, a member of the Monroe
County Health Board, and had long been closely affiliated with promoting the
activities of the Belmont-Monroe reunion. Politically he was a Democrat and in
1880-81 served as representative to the Ohio General Assembly. Also, he was a
member of the Building Commission under whose able supervision and inspections
the present Monroe County court house was erected, and served two terms as
County Auditor, 1904-1908.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

humanity so faithfully, so courageously and so ably as that privilege was given
to Dr. Steward. He was more than physician to his hundreds of patients: he was
a friendly guide and counselor, as well. That his ministrations were more than
physical is attested by the fact that he was that type of physician of whom his
patients were proud to say that they      felt better the minute he entered the
sick-room.     <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>                         </span>On last Sunday morning a patient called at Dr. Steward home
for medical aid. He was met at the door by S. V. Steward, a son, who tried to
convince the caller that Dr. Steward was in no condition to see him. Dr.
Steward, overhearing the conversation, exercised his parental authority and
ordered the patient admitted. He prescribed for him, and shortly thereafter Dr.
Steward was suffering such pain, that Dr. McMullen of Somerton, a lifelong
friend, was summoned. He administered an opiate and said he would return later.
At about the time the effect of the opiate might have been to disappear, Dr.
Steward     s condition showed no appreciable change. Dr. McMullen then stated that
the patient     s condition warranted the calling in of another physician for
consultation. Dr. Lowe of Woodsfield was called later and it was ascertained
that Dr. Steward had sustained a cerebral hemorrhage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

remain active in the practice of his profession until the very last. How fully
this wish was gratified is shown by the fact that shortly after prescribing for
his last patient he lapsed into a coma from which he did not rally. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
