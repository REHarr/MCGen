<p align=center style='text-align:center'>By Gordon Mitchell</p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>The Greenville
Treaty of 1795 finally brought peace to the Ohio Valley and opened up about
two-thirds of the present State of Ohio to European settlement. Many of the
settlers came west to collect their land warrants that they received as payment
for their services in the Revolutionary war. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Floating down the
Ohio River on flatboats was the main method of transportation used by the
settlers to reach their newly acquired lands. Unfortunately, travel down the
Ohio River was hampered by ice in the winter and by sandbars in the summer.
Travel upriver was even more difficult and had to be done by keel boat. It took
about seven days to travel down river from Pittsburgh to Cincinnati and it took
about 13 days to travel that same distance upriver. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>General Arthur St.
Clair, governor of the Northwest Territory, also wanted a military route across
Ohio. Indeed, a better route had to be found. Colonel Ebenezer Zane, a leading
resident of Wheeling, had the answer to this problem. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Ebenezer Zane, of
Danish descent, was born in Virginia's Potomac River Valley on October 7, 1747.
In 1796 Ebenezer, his wife, the former Elizabeth McCulloch, and his siblings:
Silas, Jonathan, Andrew, Isaac, and Elizabeth, settled at present Wheeling,
West Virginia, and built Fort Fincastle. Ebenezer later renamed kit Fort Henry
(renamed in 1771 to honor Virginia's governor, Patrick Henry). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>In 1777 and in 1782
Fort Henry withstood major attacks by both the British and their Indian allies.
One of those battles is where Samuel McCulloch and his horse survived a leap
off a cliff to evade the Indians (Even the Indians cheered his daring leap).
One of those battles is also where Elizabeth Zane made her daring run from the
fort to a nearby blockhouse to fetch more powder and lead. Other residents of
this community were: Lydia Boggs, Hamilton Kerr (or Carr), the McCulloch
brothers, Abraham, George, Samuel, and John; and the Wetzel brothers: Martin,
Jacob and Lewis. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>The Zanes were all
very knowledgeable in wood-lore and in Indian cultures. Isaac Zane was captured
and then adopted by the Wyandot tribe. He later married Myeerah, daughter of
Wyandot Chief Tarhe (the Crain). Isaac later assisted the American government
with peace negotiations and was awarded some land near present-day Zanesfield
in Logan County. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Ebenezer's
great-grandson was the famous western writer, Zane Grey (nee Pearl Zane Gray).
His first three novels, &quot;Betty Zane,&quot; &quot;Spirit of the
Border,&quot; and &quot;The Last Trail,&quot; were fictionalized accounts of
the Zane family at Fort Henry during the American Revolution. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Colonel Zane, who
finished a route from Pittsburgh to Wheeling, proposed a route that would start
across the Ohio River from Wheeling and would travel to Limestone (now
Maysville), Kentucky. Not only would this route be used for the new
homesteaders, it could also be used as a mail route. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>On March 25, 1796,
Colonel Zane petitioned Congress for a contract to build this road. Before he
even received this contract on May 17, 1796, Colonel Zane had already started
construction, using his own resources. The terms of the contract stated that he
had to complete construction by January 1, 1797. However, he didn't finish the
project until the following fall. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>As payment for this
project, Colonel Zane was to receive three parcels of land, each a 1-mile
square or 640 acre tract' where the trace crosses the Muskingum, the
Hockhocking (or Hocking), and the Scioto Rivers. However, Colonel Zane had to
survey these land tracts at his own expense and had to send plats of these
surveys to the treasurer of the United States (Surveyor General Rufus Putnam of
Marietta had the tracts surveyed.) He also had to operate ferry services at
each of the <i>three </i>rivers with their toll rates set by two of the three
Northwest Territory judges (Some ofthese earlyfenies were two canoes lashed
together). Colonel Zane picked his own crew for the construction of the trace.
His brother, Jonathan, and an Indian, Tomepomehala, served as the trail guides.
Other members of the crew were John McIntire, Ebenezer's son-in-law; William
McCulloch, Ebenezer's nephew; John Green, Ebenezer Ryan, Ebenezer's
step-nephew; Levi Williams, and James Worley. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>The original trace
was only wide enough for foot and horse travel. It could not accommodate
wagons. Whenever possible, the trace followed routes that were used by the
Indians or by traders. Some of the trails that the trace followed were the
Mingo, the Moxahala, and the Coshocton trails. Although the original trace
wasn't formally surveyed, the trees along the route were marked with axes.
Sometimes, more than one route was proposed or blazed. Except for some
rerouting, there were few improvements done to the trace until 1802. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>One area that
Colonel Zane did not choose as one of his three land grants was along Wills
Creek, near present day Cambridge. He may have regretted this decision in his
later years. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>When the trace
reached the Muskingum River, Colonel Zane chose the junction of the Licking and
Muskingum Rivers as the crossing over a spot farther south (present-day-Duncan
Falls) because of the potential for waterpower and the ease of crossing. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Colonel Zane's 640
acres became the town of Westbourn, renamed Zanesville in 1801. Until Zane made
some improvements to the trace in that area, he did not receive title to that
tract until 1800. On December 19, 1800 Ebenezer Zane deeded the tract to
Jonathan Zane, who plotted out Westbourn, and to John McIntire for $100.
William McCulloch and Henry Crooks were Zanesville's first settlers. The
western part of present-day Zanesville, which was founded by Levi Whipple and
by Dr. Increase Matthews, Rufus Putnam's nephew, was first named Springfield
and later renamed Putnam. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Colonel Zane's
tract on the Hocking River was located on a river ford that was called the
&quot;crossings of the Hockhocking.&quot; This tract was first named New
Lancaster in 1800 but later renamed Lancaster in <i>1805. </i>Ebenezer plotted
the town and had his sons, John and Noah, sell the lots. Depending upon the
location, the costs of these lots ranged from $5 to $50. Lancaster's Public
Square, located at Broad and Main Streets, was divided into four equal squares
and was deeded by the Zanes to the town solely for public use. The area's first
settler was Captain Joseph Hunter who arrived in April of 1798. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Because Chillicothe
had been founded on the Scioto River's west side by Nathaniel Massie in 1796,
Colonel Zane had to settle for the east side of the river for his tract. Ohio
land west of the Scioto River was part of the Virginia Military District. Unfortunately,
Zane's Chillicothe tract was not very successful. Wills Creek probably would
have been a more profitable choice. Humphrey Fullerton purchased this tract in
1804 for $5,190. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Colonel Zane's plan
was to place out each town into lots and to sell them for large profits. He
demanded one-fourth payment within the first two weeks and the rest of the
payment within two years. He offered free land to tradesmen (blacksmiths,
carpenters, etc.) if they agreed to stay for four years and to practice their
trades. Five lots were reserved for schools, for churches, and for other
community uses. The first settlers usually received the choicest lots. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>In 1803 Ohio
achieved its statehood, Ohio's new government passed some enabling legislation
that required three percent of income from land sales were to be used for road
building. On February 18, 1804 The Ohio legislation voted to spend $15 dollars
per mile to improve Zane's Trace. Afterwards, Zane's Trace was straightened,
was widened to 20 feet, had stumps cut below one foot, had bridges built, and
was corduroyed with logs in wet areas. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Even with
improvements, travel was still slow and difficult on Zane's Trace. There were
still problems with hills, wheel ruts, streams and wet areas. It took an
average of five days to travel the entire 228 miles. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>However, Zane's
Trace did bring a lot of economic prosperity to Ohio. Many inns, taverns, and
towns sprang up within a few years. Some of these business establishments were
only spaced about four miles apart and paid license fees to maintain the trace.
Many freight and stagecoach lines also used the trace. Many other roads were
built to connect to the Zane's Trace. Some of the famous people who traveled
Zane's Trace were President James Monroe, future President Andrew Jackson,
Henry Clay and future King Louis Philippe of France. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Some other names
for Zane's Trace at various locations along its rout were Tod's Trace,
Maysville Road, Maysville Pike, Limestone Road, Limestone and Chillicothe Road,
Zanesville Pike and Wheeling Road. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>To follow Zane's
Trace today, start at Wheeling and follow U.S. 40 west to Zanesville. From
Zanesville, follow U.S. 22 southwest to Lancaster. Just west of Lancaster turn
on S.R. 159 and follow it southwest to Chillicothe. From Chillicothe, follow
U.S. 50 west to Bainbridge. Then follow S.R. 41 southwest to Aberdeen on the
Ohio River. Zane</span><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
