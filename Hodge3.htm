<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Sometime during the first half of the nineteenth
century two HODGE families came to Monroe County from Pennsylvania. William
Hodge (about 1777 - February 20, 1871) was a farmer and appears to have arrived
in the early 1840s. This estimate of the time of his arrival is based on the
fact that he purchased land in Bethel Township in 1844. James Hodge (about 1778
- October 29, 1851) is believed to be the brother of William Hodge (about 1777
- February 20, 1871) and may have come to Monroe County at the same time or
possibly earlier. James is listed in Malaga in the 1840 census. A William Hodge
is also listed as being in Malaga in the 1840 census, but it is not clear
whether this was James father, who was also named William Hodge (about 1757 -
about October 1852), or his brother who subsequently purchased land in Bethel
Township. In the 1850 census James was listed as being a tailor and lived in or
near the town of Malaga, Ohio. At the time of the 1850 census, William was 73
years old and James was 72 years old. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Both the 1850 and 1860 census indicated that William
Hodge was head of his household at ages 73 and 84 respectively. In 1850 six
people are enumerated in his household: William (age 73); Martha (age 25); Mary
(14); Phebe (10); William R. (11); and Samuel (24).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Ten years later at the 1860 census, the household
was enumerated as 4 people: William (age 84); Samuel (age 38); Samuel's wife,
Catharine (30) and their son, John W. Hodge (8 months). In 1860 Martha and Mary
A. were enumerated as a separate household which included a third member,
Luther Tippans (age 12). This second household was enumerated sequentially with
that of the William Hodge household indicating that the two residences must
have been close together or possibly even contiguous. It is quite possible that
this may have been the census-taker=s way of showing that there were two
components of this family. By the time of the 1860 census, William was
apparently too old to care for the farm and Samuel and his family had
effectively taken it over. William R. Hodge who would have been about 21 years
old was absent from the 1860 census count.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Most of the records that would have contained
information about the Hodge families in Monroe County were lost in the Monroe
County courthouse fire of 1867. As a result, facts about the Hodge family in
Monroe County are sparse. However, a lawsuit involving William Hodge, father of
James Hodge (about 1778 - October 29, 1851) and probably William Hodge (about
1777 - February 20, 1871) provides considerable insight and information about
the family. Information from the court records is as follows: Peter Waddle,
plaintiff, of Bethel Township, Monroe County, Ohio asserted that on March 5,
1847 William Hodge, defendant, borrowed a mare which he drove from Bethel
Township to Malaga [a distance of perhaps 20 miles]. Waddle said that Hodge abused
the mare that then sickened and became of no value. The mare died on April 1,
1847. Waddle asked $90 damages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>On April 24, 1847 at 12:o'clock the defendant,
William Hodge (about 1757 - about October 1852) appeared and disputed the
plaintiff's claim and demanded a jury trial. The trial was held on May 1, 1874.
Jurors included Henry Winland, Robert Martin, Jacob Miller, Sen. William
Holden, Francis Miller and Jack Miller, Jr. The jury found for the plaintiff in
the amount of $60 plus $34.70 up to this date, May 3. The defendant's witnesses
included: Robert Gatchel, Jonathan Conner, John L. Henthorn, John Enlow,
Matthew Scott, Thomas Fisher, William Hodge, James Hodge, Martha Hodge,
Elisabeth Enlow, Samuel Fisher, James Enlow, James Thomson, John Moray and
Samuel Hodge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>On May 3, 1847, apparently at the end of the trial,
&quot;James Hodge, son, and Jonathan Connor do acknowledge ourselves bail for
William Hodge in the sum of $250 to be levied of our goods and chattels.&quot;
This transaction occurred before Thomas Miller, a Justice of Peace for Bethel
Township, Monroe County. This bail or bond identifies the defendant, William
Hodge (about 1757 - about October 1852), to be the father of James Hodge (about
1778 - October 29, 1851) of Malaga, Ohio and likely the father of William Hodge
(about 1777 - February 20, 1871) of Bethel Township. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>According to the 1850 census, James Hodge (about
1778 - October 29, 1851) of Malaga was then 72 years old. This age is confirmed
by his death record. At the time of the trial on May 1, 1847 he would have been
68 or 69 years old, depending on what date his birthday fell. If we assume that
his father, William Hodge, had been about 20 years old when James was born,
this would have made William around 88 when he borrowed the mare. The estimate
of his dates of birth and death that have been used here are based on this
conclusion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>William Hodge (about 1757 - about October 1852)
never paid the court-assessed penalty. According to the court records,
&quot;William Hodge died in the October term of this Court in 1852,&quot;
leaving his estate insolvent. We do not know the exact date of his death. The
records indicate that James Hodge had died the year prior to his father on
October 29, 1851. On November 1, 1852 Peter Waddle caused the only surviving
bond-holder, Jonathan Connor, to pay the full amount of the judgment, $122.60. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Jonathan Connor was apparently a friend of the Hodge
family. He testified for William Hodge at his trial in May of 1847 and within a
day or two co-signed, with William's son, James Hodge, a bail bond for
William's release. But, little did he expect that both his co-signer, James,
and William Hodge would soon die leaving him to pay the full bill.
Understandably, Jonathan Conner wanted to recoup his money. So on May 23, 1860
Jonathan Conner brought a civil action against the heirs of James Hodge.
Jonathan Conner knew that James Hodge had owned lot number 3 adjoining the town
of Malaga on the west side and that the heirs of James had sold this lot to
Peter Mann for $120. Peter Mann had not yet paid for the lot, however, even
though he had built on the property and paid the taxes on it. Peter Mann had
deferred payment until he could get a clear title to the property. Jonathan Conner's
objective with the suit was to cause the James Hodge's heirs to provide a clear
title to the lot so that Peter Mann could pay for it and the money for the sale
would be given to him as repayment for having to pay Peter Waddle for the bail
bond.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>The
May 23, 1860 civil action, Jonathan Conner versus Hodge, specified the
following as defendants: Peter Mann; Kinworthy Hodge [in California]; William
Hodge who lived in Maryland; John Hodge; Robert Hodge who lived in Monroe
County; Joseph Hodge who resided in Noble County; Margaret Hodge Starr who
married Moses Starr; and a single daughter who lived in Guernsey County, Ohio.
The Court issue a summons to the sheriff stating: &quot;You are commanded to
notify [defendants] that they have been sued by Jonathan Conner in the Court of
Common Pleas of Monroe County and that unless they answer by 23 June 1860, the
petition in said case as against them will be taken as true and judgment
rendered accordingly &quot; Peter Mann's answer was that he was ready to pay
the $120 as soon as he got a deed. He had bought the lot from Robert Hodge on
March 14, 1856 as an agent of the heirs. The case was resolved by Robert Hodge.
The other heirs did not answer. Peter Mann paid the court $120 and got a clear
deed. Conner got his money.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
