mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>The first school building in Summit Township was like
all others, built in a wilderness. The building was usually built of round
logs. The floor was made of logs smoothed on one side. The walls were chunked
and doubled between the logs. A fireplace occupied the entire end of the
building. For lights, an unchunked and undoubled space was left between the
logs on three sides. These open spaces were covered with greased paper, glass
was a luxury that could not be afforded. The seats were made of split logs with
legs in the under side. The writing desks were made by boring holes in the
logs. Long pins were inserted in these holes. Flat boards of the desired length
were fastened to these pins. This made a flat surface for a desk.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

into Woodsfield in 1874. It was the countries second railroad and went into
operation between Woodsfield and Bellaire on Thanksgiving Day 1879, and between
Caldwell and Zanesville in November 1883. The road between Bellaire and
Zanesville later went under the control of the Pennsylvania Railroad System. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>The directors of the road hoped someday to make the
railroad into a broad gauge, but it remained a narrow gauge as long as it was
in operation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But the time came early
in 1928 when the competition of buses, cars, and other vehicles proved too much
for the Railroad System and on May 1 of that year it was abandoned between
Zanesville and Woodsfield.&nbsp;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was
the last of Ohios narrow gauge and it made its final trip between Zanesville
through Caldwell to Woodsfield on May 1, 1928, after serving Monroe and
neighboring counties for over thirty-five years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
