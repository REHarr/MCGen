<p align=center style='text-align:center'>by R.E. Harrington</p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>From our vantage point in time, it is
difficult to visualize life on the American Frontier 200 years ago. One of the
main reasons for this, of course, is that we live in a world of wall-to-wall
people; fenced property; paved roads; automobiles; airplanes; telephones; TV;
running water; computers; Internet; supermarkets; laws governing most
activities; and much, much more. To visualize the American Frontier of the late
1700s we must first be able to visualize a world with all of those things
missing. It was a world of nothing but trees, nature, weather, and lots and
lots of unknown and uncertainties. It was a world full of deer, bear, elk,
mountain lions, wild turkey, wolves, squirrel, coon, and more. Personal
security for the people who lived on the frontier was thin and ephemeral. A
state of perpetual guerrilla warfare existed with a sparse but ever present
Indian enemy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>By the late 1700s, the frontier had been
pushed westward over the Appalachian Mountains. Much of what is now Ohio and
Kentucky was still Indian country. The steady movement of the frontier westward
had become a threat to the Native American Indians. The clash between the </span><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span><span
style='font-size:13.5pt'>hunter-gatherer</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>
culture of the Indians and the farming culture of the white settlers was
inevitable. Injustices committed by both cultures became excuses for
hostilities on each sides. For decades the accepted relationship between the
Indians and the white settlers had been one of intense suspicion, hostility and
frequently open war. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>As in most human relations over the
centuries, the issues of economics lay scarcely hidden beneath the hostile
actions of both of the warring sides. White settlers with their concept of land
ownership were aggressive in their pursuit of free or cheap lands. The existing
state and federal governments contributed to pressure to move into Indian land
by first claiming sovereignty over the land, then using it as payments for
military service. It was also sold to land companies as a source of revenue for
the state and federal governments.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Although the Indian Nations did not use the
concept of land ownership, as hunters and gatherers they saw that the real
estate that provided their livelihood was continually being diminished. Because
of the unique Indian hunter-gatherer live style combined with the need to
prevent the white settlers from pushing them into extinction, and because of
the prospects of gaining riches from the white man in the form of horses,
rifles, and other loot, it was perhaps a logical and natural expectation that
the Indians would mount raids on the encroaching whites. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>So accepted had the practice of raiding the
white settlers become that over time a corridor, of sorts, had been established
that raiding parties of Indians from northern and central Ohio followed to
penetrate into Virginia. This corridor or war path crossed the Ohio River at
roughly the point where Captain John Baker had built a blockhouse surrounded by
a stockade. Captina Creek was a tributary on the Ohio side of the river which
formed a part of the corridor or war path.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>The story teller of the </span><a
href="Captina.htm"><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&quot;Battle of Captina&quot;</span></a><span
style='font-size:13.5pt'> was Martin Baker, son of Captain John Baker, second
youngest son of Captain John Baker. In May 1794, the month of the skirmish
between an Indian war party and the whites from Fort Baker, Martin Baker who
was born on October 10, 1780 was just 13 </span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>2</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>
years old. Luckily for the author of this article, he was too young to engage
in combat with warring Indians. Martin lived to be 77 years old. He died April
27, 1857 and was buried in Steed Cemetery in Monroe County just outside
Woodsfield, Ohio. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Martin</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>s
older brother, </span><a href="Captina.htm"><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>John
Baker Jr.</span></a><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>, who was killed by the
Indians during the battle of Captina was about 29 years old. John was born in
1765. His date of death is given as May 22, 1794 which, if correct, fixes more
precisely the date of the Battle of Captina. John was married to Elizabeth Parr
and the couple had a son, John Baker, Jr..<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Ironically, Martin and John Baker</span><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span
style='font-size:13.5pt'>s father, Captain John Baker, had been killed by the
Indians in 1787, seven years earlier than the battle of Captina, close to the spot
where John Baker, Jr. was killed in 1794. Captain John Baker was about 50 years
old at the time of his death. John Baker, Sr. had been born in Bingen, Germany.
By the age of about 21 years he had immigrated to America, had wed Elizabeth
Sullivan in Philadelphia, PA and had started a family. John and Elizabeth</span><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span
style='font-size:13.5pt'>s first two of their 11 children were twin girls,
Catherine and Margaret Baker. These twins later married Yoho brothers, Henry
and Peter Yoho. During the remainder of his life John Baker completed several
enlistments in the army of the Colony of Virginia where he earned his title of
Captain. His military career include service during the American Revolutionary
War.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Captain Baker and his family was one of the
pioneer families moving ever westward. In 1784 John built his blockhouse
surrounded by a stockade at Cresap</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>s
Bottom on the Virginia (now West Virginia) side of the Ohio River. The facility
became known as </span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span><span

font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt'> It
provide safe quarters for his family and others during times of siege. Being
strategically located on the Ohio River at the intersection with the Indian war
path, it was a frequent stop on the route of white travelers, hunters, scouts,
and Indian fighters passing through the area. Across the Ohio River from Baker</span><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span
style='font-size:13.5pt'>s Fort was Captina Creek, the setting of the Battle of
Captina.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>According to the story told of Captain John
Baker</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span
style='font-size:13.5pt'>s fate, in 1787 John Wetzel and his son, George, were
at Baker</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span
style='font-size:13.5pt'>s Station when they and Captain Baker noticed some
Indians on the Ohio shore walking leisurely about. Baker shot at one of them
and killed him. The others appeared frightened and ran away leaving the dead
Indian behind. Baker and the Wetzels crossed the river and were viewing the
dead Indian when several shots were fired at them. Apparently the Indians had
feigned fright to lure the whites into a trap. Captain Baker fell, mortally
wounded. The Wetzels </span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span><span
style='font-size:13.5pt'>treed</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt'> (meaning they
took cover behind trees or rocks) and commenced firing back. Several more men
crossed the river to reinforce them and drove the Indians off. Captain Baker
had crawled a short distance from where he had fallen and was alive but he died
soon after arriving back at the station. He was buried on the flat near a
stream called </span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span><span
style='font-size:13.5pt'>Grave Yard Run</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;

the upper end of Cresap</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span
style='font-size:13.5pt'>s Bottom.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Elizabeth Sullivan Baker stayed on at Baker</span><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span
style='font-size:13.5pt'>s Station for several more years following the 1787
death of her husband Captain John Baker and the 1794 death of her son, John
Baker, Jr. In 1804 she moved with her son, Martin Baker, the story teller of
the Battle of Captina, across the Ohio River to Washington Township in Belmont
County, Ohio. Nine years later, in 1813 Elizabeth Baker again moved with her
son, Martin, to Monroe County, Ohio where Martin had purchased the northwest quarter
of Section 23, Range 5 on September 3, 1813. This property is located about 2
miles south of Woodsfield, Ohio at the intersection of Ohio Route # 800 and
Monroe County Route # 26. It is currently known as the Matz farm. Elizabeth
died there on May 22, 1836 at the age of 92 years, 3 months and 8 days. She is
buried beside Martin Baker and his family in the Steed Cemetery which is on the
same quarter of land purchased by Martin Baker in 1813.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
