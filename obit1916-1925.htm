six children, namely: Walter B., Clarrissa O., Washington D., Addison D.,
Celesta O. and Dora L.&nbsp; She obeyed the gospel when about 15 years of age.
She has been fighting off that dreaded disease tuberculosis for about 25 years.
And her last sickness of about 13 months has been a heroic struggle, but she
had to surrender for the time to that grim monster- death. But being Christ=s
she went into&nbsp; the channel house of death, with full confidence and hope
of His deliverance when He comes. She was a faithful and good christian wife, a
loving mother. By her death Brother Bracy has lost a companion; the children a
dear mother, the Church a good member and village a good neighbor. But what is
our loss is her eternal gain. Let us all imitate her virtues and profit by her
mistakes and make sure to meet her in that Asweet bye and bye@ where God will

serious illness of a little over two weeks. He had been in rather indifferent

recently, when spasmodic neuritis in a form baffling all medical skill attacked
his weakened constitution.&nbsp; He was born at <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City

midnight. </span><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

No motive could be learned. Members of the family say she was in good health
and spirits. During the day she sang and played the piano at her home. Going to
the Church in the evening she sang in the choir and in her demeanor there was
nothing to indicate that she contemplated suicide. Returning home with other
members of the family the young lady remained downstairs reading after the
others had retired. About eleven o     clock she went to her mother     s bed and
remarked,      I feel queer.      Asked what the trouble was she is said to have
answered,      I took strychnine,      A bottle containing the poison had been left in
a downstairs cupboard.      Do something for me or I     ll die,      she is said to have
urged. F. E. Cline, father of the girl, hurried for Dr. Edwards. <br>
Two minutes after he arrived at the home the young lady expired. The father is
a stonemason and carpenter. The dead girl is survived by three sisters and four
brothers. Funeral services will be held Thursday afternoon. Miss Cline formerly
worked here in town and was well liked by everybody who knew her.&nbsp; <br>

Oliver L. Jackson, son of Jeremiah and Ellen Jackson, was born June 21, 1879,
and died November 29, 1916, aged thirty-seven years, five months and eight
days. The last sixteen years of his life was spent in extensive travel. During
his travels he contracted that dreaded disease tuberculosis. Last August he
returned with the thought that a change of climate might restore his health.
But in spite of all that loving hands could do to alleviate his suffering, he
passed to his reward. He bore his suffering with remarkable strength and
fortitude, and a short time before the end remarked, that having witnessed a
good portion of what this old world contained, he was ready to pass over and
learn what was on the other side. He leaves to mourn his departure, father,
mother and one brother and many relatives. Funeral services were held at the
home Friday, December 1, with Brother D. W. Harkins officiating, after which he
was laid to rest in Oaklawn cemetery. May he rest in peace.&nbsp;</span><span

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; William Daugherty, aged 43 years, of Benwood, West Virginia,
was instantly killed and Mrs. Steve Pollack and four year old daughter
seriously, probably fatally injured, when a touring car driven by Daugherty
went over the narrows, below McMechen, at 3:20 o     clock Sunday afternoon. The
car dropped about 25 feet and then rolled 70 feet down the hillside to the ditch
along the B. &amp; O. tracks. Mrs. Pollack sustained a compound fracture of the
thigh, two broken fingers and is thought to be internally injured. Her daughter
received a fractured skull. Sam Visnick, his wife and son, the other occupants
of the car, were only slightly injured.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daugherty was found with his head pinned under the fender
and resting on the ground and his feet in the car between the steering wheel
rod and the seat. Mrs. Pollack and her child were laying in the ditch along
side of the car. Visnick, his wife and son fell from the car where it struck
last, about 20 feet above the level of the B. &amp; O. tracks before taking its
final drop. Visnick lodged against a small tree, and his wife and child rolled
on down the hillside.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Dougherty, who was a nephew of Auditor T. A. Dougherty,
of Woodsfield, had been an employee of the Hitchman Coal company for probably
ten or twelve years. He operated on of the machines used in the mining of coal.
He and his wife and their three sons, the oldest a young man, resided on <st1:Street

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A writer from Summerfield, Ohio to the Zanesville Signal
gives the following account of the double tragedy enacted at that place Friday,
January 5, 1917. The writer says:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When little Holly Williams, aged 11, returned to his home
here after school Friday afternoon, he found his mother Mrs. Maud Williams, 50,
dead on the floor in the dining room; a few seconds later the child heard the
report of a revolver shot in an upper room which resulted ten hours later in
the death of his father, Dr. John H. Williams.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All circumstances surrounding the tragedy indicate that Dr.
Williams killed his wife at 3 o     clock Friday afternoon by firing a bullet into
her temple. Disordered condition of the furniture of the room point out that
Mrs. Williams made a terrible struggle for her life.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stung by the grief-stricken screams of his young son when he
returned from school, and unable to face the accusing eyes of his child, Dr.
Williams took his own life at 3:30 o     clock with the same weapon which he had
used in murdering his wife. Dr. Williams      body was found in a bedroom in the
second story of the house. He died early Saturday morning without regaining
consciousness, and leaving no explanation for the double shooting. He was 60
years old.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A 38 caliber revolver was used by Dr. Williams in the
shooting. The fact that the physician was at one time confined in a sanitarium
for mental derangement leads the authorities to believe that the crime and
suicide were committed while Dr. Williams was not mentally responsible for his
deeds.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both Dr. and Mrs. Williams were socially prominent and
highly esteemed. Dr. Williams had practiced medicine for over thirty years. He
was a mason and a member of the Knights of Pythias.&nbsp; Mrs. Williams was an
active member of the Summerfield M. E. Church. The eleven-year old son is their
only child but Mrs. Williams is also survived by several children by her first
husband, Frank Reed. They are Miss Hattie Reed of Zanesville, Ohio, Mrs. Vivian
Ward of Cleveland, Ohio, Ford Reed of Jackson, Michigan, Con Reed of Salt Lake
City, Utah, Rodger Reed of Canton, Ohio, Mrs. T. S. Becker of American Falls,
Idaho, Miss Clara Reed of Woodsfield and William Reed of Summerfield.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Williams had also been previously married.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. and Mrs. Williams were well known in Woodsfield, Mrs.
Williams at one time being a resident here.&nbsp; <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is with sadness we note the death of our friend and
neighbor, Mrs. Hariett Gatchell&nbsp; who was born July 7, 1844, and departed
from this life February 5, 1917, being at the time of her death 72 years, six
months and 29 days of age. She united with the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Baptist</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Church</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
at this place in the year of 1865. As a friend and neighbor a community would
need no better. She was always cheerful and ready and willing to lend a helping
hand to those in need, and gave good advice to all. She seemed to have always
had her share of disappointments and adversities of this life, but bore them
all with Christian grace and fortitude, never murmured or complained but was
always willing and submissive to the will of Him who doeth all things well.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Harriet A. Westbrook was married to Winfield J. Gatchell

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A distressing accident occurred at the home of Mr. Arthur
Greenbank about a mile and a half from <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Lewisville</st1:place></st1:City>
Saturday morning.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Greenbank had gone to one of the upstairs rooms for
some purpose, and upon opening the door smelled the escaping gas. She located
it at an open valve, were the key in some manner had been turned. She turned
the key, closing the valve and was leaving the room, when the escaping gas, having
reached the hall, was set off by a light burning there. The force of the <br>
explosion blew out several windows and the house caught fire, but the flames
were extinguished, some furniture and bedding being destroyed, Miss Greenbank
assisting heroically in spite of serious injuries.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blanche Greenbank, a four-year old daughter, was so badly
burned that she died Sunday morning. Three other members of the family were
also severely burned. Miss Jane Greenbank, a sister of Mr. Greenbank, was
burned so seriously that it is feared it may be necessary to amputate one of
her hands. Both hands and arms are badly burned. She was also burned about the
breast and on both legs. Two other little daughters received severe injuries
from the flames.<br>

was able to come down street a few times after being stricken, but when he made
his last visit with us last week it was very plain that he would not recover.

 w:st="on">Ohio</st1:State></st1:place>, September 17, 1904. He died at <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Lewisville</st1:place></st1:City>, R. R. 1 on
December 20, 1918, bringing his total age to 14 years, 3 months, and 3 days. He
was taken with a slight headache a few days ago, which however turned into
violent pains in the spine and head and brought his young days to a rapid
close. How often are we not faced by death in this life. We always tremble and
totter in fear before it and it is well that we do for it is our greatest
enemy. Quickly it is upon us - - to some are given days of thought and
penitence before it come, to others it comes on the wings of eagles. Whether we
desire it or not we must accept it. The Materialist accepts it stoically, the
atheist with alarm, the thoughtless with fright; the Christian alone can meet
it as a challenge with honor, for to him have been given the weapons, against
which death cannot survive. It often surprises him that it comes so early but
his surprise is only the signal to get out his      sword of the Spirit      and to put
on his      shield of faith      and against such spiritual armor of defense and
offense, death cannot and never will prevail. On the cross our Savior showed us
what      faith, hope and love      can do against death and we are true followers if
we learn from him.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such were our thoughts when the neighbors collected on
Sunday afternoon, December 22, 1918, to pay last respects and reverence to the
memory of one, who though only 14 years of age, was missed, when he died. He was
a quiet boy to the outward observer, but whistling and singing when roaming
abroad in solitude. We cannot but praise him when we think that of his fourteen
years he had gone seven to Sunday School without voluntarily missing a single
service. He was to receive a diploma for this faithfulness. We are sorry that
he died before he had received it. He leaves behind many mourning friends and
relatives. First among whom is his stepmother, who was as good to him as <st1:City

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sad death occurred at the Lewis G. Rose place 10 miles
from the town of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Bloomfield</st1:City>,
 <st1:State w:st="on">Iowa</st1:State></st1:place>.&nbsp; Mr. L. G. Rose became
a suicide on last Wednesday forenoon, March 12, 1919. Lewis Rose was born at <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Lewisville</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Ohio</st1:State></st1:place>,
May 23, 1863. In 1883 the family moved to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Hornick</st1:City>,
 <st1:State w:st="on">Iowa</st1:State></st1:place>. Here he married on May 19,
1885, to Lusetta Smith his present mourning widow. In 1904 the L. G. Rose
family moved to this neighborhood.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their union was blessed with seven children: Mrs. Bertha

Amelia; and Arthur all at home; and 3 grandchildren, two brothers and five
sisters mourn his sad and untimely death. His age being 55 years 8 months and
11 days.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lewis Rose has the reputation of being honest and true
neighbor, and friend. The entire neighborhood speak well of him. He was also a
true Christian. He was a regular attendant of public worship. He loved to do
good work and charity. What caused him to end his life nobody knows because
there was no reason for it, and no family trouble whatever. But he was so
sickly and his health had been failing for some time. The only explanation we
can find is this: He did it in a state of melancholy in a depressed spirit.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Short funeral services were held at the house on this week
Tuesday, after which the burial followed. After the burial the Reverend A.

a son of Mr. and Mrs. George Michael Pfalzgraf who came to this country in 1832
from Alsace Lorraine. John grew to manhood on the farm which was government
land when his father secured it and is now owned by the youngest son, George
Pfalzgraf.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On February 17, 1864, he was married to Miss Catherine
Christman. The next year he moved to the farm originally contained 670 acres.
The land was entered in 1831 and the patent deed was signed by Andrew Jackson.
Mr. Pfalzgraf was an industrious farmer and the farm became a valuable one, and
especially in the last few years when it was found to have exceptional <br>
deposits of coal under it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. Pfalzgraf raised a family of twelve children,
all of whom with his widow are living except two, William Pfalzgraf, who died
at the age of five years and George Pfalzgraf, who was killed in an accident in
<st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pittsburgh</st1:place></st1:City>
several years ago. Those living are: Mrs. Barbara Walton, of Round Bottom;
Jacob A. Pfalzgraf, of Coyle, Oklahoma; John Pfalzgraf, of Clarington, Route 3;
Mrs. Louise Metzger, of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Alex Pfalzgraf, at home; Mrs.
Christina Christman, Bowie, Texas; Lewis E. Pfalzgraf of Round Bottom; Samuel
Pfalzgraf of Cameron; Ben Pfalzgraf of Greely, Colorado, and Miss Mary
Pfalzgraf at Boulder, Colorado.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1873, Mr. Pfalzgraf was elected Infirmary Director and
served the county in that capacity for six years. In 1889, he was elected <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">County</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Commissioner</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>
which office he held for six years and nine months, being present of the board.

For the thirty years preceding his death he had been a member of Clarington
Lodge No. 346 K. of P. and was a strong advocate of the high principles of that
fraternal organization.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a youth, he was confirmed in the Lutheran Church at
Middle Church but after moving to the eastern part of the county had a little
opportunity to attend the services of the Church of his chosen faith. In
personality, Mr. Pfalzgraf was open hearted, kind and friendly and many young
people long since in homes of their own remember the good times the hospitable
home afforded years ago.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the past years, Mr. Pfalzgraf had been in rather poor
health, yet considering years and infirmities his active will refused to submit
where a man of less stamina would have yielded. He died at his home near
Altitude Saturday morning, May 10th, and the funeral services were held at the
home and at Pleasant Ridge Church the following Monday, conducted by the
Reverend C. H. Roe, of the M. E. Church at Clarington. Interment in the

Collection of Beryl Christman Claus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despondency, brought on by continued ill health, is held responsible
for the death by suicide of Louise Hettig, aged 24, at her home about 1 1/2
miles north of Lewisville, Ohio, Tuesday evening, February 21, 1922.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Hettig, according to information from <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Lewisville</st1:place></st1:City>, was unwilling to go to a hospital
for treatment. It was said that she gave no indication of her intention to
members of the family excepting a remark made on Monday, when she asserted that
she did not expect to live long. Tuesday evening she was found on a porch by a
brother, breathing her last, her throat cut. A <br>
butcher knife was close by.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Owing to the fact that there is no qualified corner in <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Monroe</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">County</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>,
Constable John Feiock served, as provided by law, and rendered a verdict of
death by suicide.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was said that a note was found later, in which the girl
gave instructions as to her burial.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She leaves her father, mother and two brothers and a sister
at home, and a sister living in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cincinnati</st1:place></st1:City>.
The funeral will be held Friday morning at the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is with sadness we are called upon to note the departure
of our friend and neighbor, James Jacob Neuhardt, son of John Michael and Mary
Catherine Schaub Neuhardt. John Michael died September 11, 1909, in <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Monroe County</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Ohio</st1:State></st1:place>

married to Miss Lucetta Bintz. To this union were born five children of which two
daughters, Clara Lucetta and Harriett Magdelina gone to the world beyond.
Harriett Magdelina Neuhardt died March 3, 1911.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a week before he passed away he seemed to be enjoying
life as usual when suddenly on Sunday afternoon, July 2, he was stricken ill.
His case was placed in the physician and upon his advice it was deemed best to
go to the hospital where he was placed in the hands of the surgeons. Although
his condition was serious they thought it best to try the gallstone operation. <br>
This for a time seemed to be successful, then uremic poising set in which
resulted in his death. Before he started to the hospital, he expressed the
thought that perhaps he might never return but was ready to face death. He was
accompanied by his faithful wife, who at his request never left him until the
end came.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Sunday afternoon, July 2, the body was brought from <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Zanesville</st1:place></st1:City> to the home to
await the funeral services which were held in the German M. E. Church near
Monroefield on Wednesday morning, July 12, and the remains were laid to rest in
the cemetery therein the presence of a large number of friends and relatives.
The services were conducted by the Reverend Theodore Lagemann of <st1:place

a former pastor and friend.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was a kind husband and devoted father and he will be
sadly missed in the home and in the community in which he has spent his life,
but we can only say      Thy will, Lord, and not ours be done.     <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He leaves to mourn his loss, his beloved wife, Lucetta Bintz
Neuhardt, three children, Franklin Samuel Neuhardt and Arthur Frederick
Neuhardt of near Lewisville and Mrs. Charlotte Amelia Neuhardt Sloan of
Miltonsburg; three grandchildren, two brothers, George E. Neuhardt of Memphis,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Sunday afternoon, August 6, 1922, our community was
shocked and saddened by the death of Jesse Carl Hossman who was born August 21,
1888, in <st1:State w:st="on">Ohio</st1:State> township, <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
 w:st="on">Monroe County</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Ohio</st1:State></st1:place>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On June 30, 1917, he was united in marriage to Miss
Oneda Christman. To this happy union one son, Elwood C. Hossman was born July
22, 1921. Shortly after their marriage they moved to a farm near <st1:City
w:st="on">Miltonsburg</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Ohio</st1:State> but
about a year ago they purchased a farm near <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Lewisville</st1:place></st1:City> at which place they resided at the
time of his death.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For several years Mr. Hossman had been suffering from
organic heart trouble and had gone to many doctors but did not seem to get much
relief.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A short time ago he was seriously ill with pneumonia but had
seemingly recovered from that sufficiently to walk about the house, but
conditions arising from the diseased heart could not be overcome until the
Great physician reached out his hand and claimed him for a higher reward.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During his early youth he united with the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Evangelical</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Church</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
at Miltonsburg by confirmation and remained a faithful member until God called
him to the Church above.&nbsp; For several years before he moved away he served
as superintendent in the Sunday school at that place.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last few years of his life he was County Grange Deputy
and has done a great deal of organization work among the granges of this
County. He was also leader of the Barnhart Poultry Club and will be sadly
missed by the young people of the club. He has always taken an active interest
in all things pertaining to the welfare of the farming communities. He was a
good citizen and neighbor, a devoted husband and father and although it is hard
to give him up in youth, we know that God has something greater in store for
him and sometime we     ll understand his plan.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Tuesday afternoon at one o     clock the funeral services
were conducted at <st1:City w:st="on">St. John     s</st1:City> middle Church by
the Reverend Wm. Dallman of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Lewisville</st1:City>,
 <st1:State w:st="on">Ohio</st1:State></st1:place> with undertaker Bauer in
attendance before a large assemblage of friends and relatives. At the grave
short and impressive service was conducted by the Miltonsburg and Barnhart
granges.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The deceased leaves to mourn his departure his wife, Mrs.
Oneda&nbsp; Hossman, on son, Elwood Charles Hossman, father, mother, Mr. and
Mrs. Carl Hossman, six brothers, Fred, Charles, Wesley, Raymond, Elmer and
Victor Hossman, two sisters, Miss Freda Hossman and Mrs. Clem Claus all living
near Miltonsburg, and an aged&nbsp; grandmother, Mrs. Magdelene igenthaler of
Round Bottom, Ohio. May God be with them in their hour of
desolation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Father Fluber. Immediately after the marriage Mr. Archer was called to serve
his country in the Civil War. He was honorably discharged from the service at <st1:place

of the Catholic church. His has been a long and useful life and he has left to
his sons and daughters no legacy more valuable than the example he set before
them. May they always remember this in their different walks of life and may
this be a guiding star to steer them in the path of righteousness.<br>
