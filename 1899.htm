and peacefully passed from this into the life beyond. She was 71 years of age
lacking one day. She had been a member of the M.E. church for many years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

father still remain. In their long married life of 43 years death enters the
family for the first time removing the dear wife and mother. Mrs. Beard was
firmly attached to her home and family and her family to her. Her cars were of
her home. No effort or sacrifice was too great for her in their behalf. She
loved them tenderly and with a devotion that spoke volumes of goodness of
heart. This heart that throbbed for others woes and rejoiced with others <span

acts of kindness and administering needs to the <span class=GramE>afflicted,</span>
are now folded for the last time across the breasts of this noble <span

irreparable. The family have the sympathy of all, especially do we sympathize
with the father and husband who for many years has been sorely afflicted, having
lost the use of his lower limbs. His companion in life is gone. The one on whom
he leaned upon for special help has passed into the beautiful beyond. Be of
good cheer, it may only be another slight affliction which will make the future

more than ordinary ability and was entrusted with positions of responsibility

served. He had been secretary of the farmers institute at Beallsville from the

were born five sons and five daughters, all of whom survive and were present at

was a member of the G.A.R. He was converted to God and joined the M.E. church
in the winter of 1870 and continued a faithful worker in the church of the day
of his demise. He longed for death to come to release him from his excruciating
misery. He was an indulgent father and a true husband. He was a man of strong
convictions; could hardly be moved from ideas once settled in his mind. The
large cortege following his remains to the church and cemetery witnessed their
esteem for the dead ad sympathy for the living. <span style='mso-tab-count:

been ailing for some weeks but her friends did not think she was seriously ill
neither was she until a few days before she expired when they began to fear
that her disease was reaching a dangerous degree. Just before she did she
express her willingness to go, as her true prospects were bright. After it was
evident that she must die, her friends seemed reluctant about giving her up;
even knowing that she would be better off by far than if she was permitted to
remain with us. Of course it is hard to part with her, knowing that we shall
meet her no more on this side of the grave, but it is consoling to know that if
we live a righteous life we will meet her at Gods right hand in heaven. I can
imagine I see Grandma standing just within the pearly gates with her left hand
beckoning us on toward that haven of eternal rest, while her right hand is

the blissful fellowship of brotherly union is no more. For more than half a
century we have associated in the holy bonds of brotherly affection without the
severing of a single fraternal tie, and this sudden bereavement falls upon us
like a thunderbolt from the serenity of a summer Sky, rending our hearts
asunder. It seems impossible to realize that our dear brother is gone from
earth to that <span class=SpellE>bourne</span> from when no traveler returns.
But while we are thus left lonely and sorrowing over the loss of one so dear,
we sorrow not as those who have no hope, for our hearts are comforted by the
blessed assurance that our dear brother is one to that land of eternal sunshine,
where no farewells are heard; and where he will be permitted to partake of the
fruit of the tree of life and bask in the bright crystal river which flows
through the City of God.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

learn of the horrible and untimely death of Theodore <span class=SpellE>Utsinger</span>
whose home was near here. He was a carpenter and had just reached and commenced
work on a barn near <st1:place w:st="on">Carlisle</st1:place> when the timber
on which he was standing broke precipitating him a distance of eighteen feet.
He struck his head foremost and received many injuries any of which would have
been fatal. When his family received the shocking news the harness had not yet
been removed from the horses which had taken him to work. His wife and daughter
immediately started to him but he died before they reached him. It was found
impossible to bring the body home, so it was interred in the Catholic cemetery
at Wills Creek. Mr. <span class=SpellE>Utsinger</span> had worked for several
of our citizens and was highly respected as a good workman, industrious and
honest, and in his family a kind husband and loving father. The family is
prostrated, and has the kindest sympathy of the community.</span> </p>

was unmarried. His death resulted from diseased <span class=GramE>lungs which
was</span> occasioned by a severe attack of measles some six years ago. Most of
his life was spent at the home of his grandmother, Mrs. Mary <span

limit. His love for her was equally as strong, pure and beautiful. When the
angel of death hovered over him he was conscious that the loved grandmother was
not present with him, although she and other kindred were expected each moment.
He said to his loving and almost heart-broken mother: I hope God will let me
live until she comes. A short time after he clasped his hand together and
said: Has she come, and soon after his spirit took its flight to that home in
heaven, where the weary are at rest. The loving grandmother and other relatives
did not arrive until death had claimed their loved one. The funeral services
were held at the home of William <span class=SpellE>Karcher</span>, Tuesday, by
Rev. W. W. Dixon of the Baptist church. The remains were interred in the
Matamoras cemetery. A large number of relatives and friends of this and other
towns and different parts of the country were present to give testimony of
their love and respect for the loved son and brother and esteemed friend. At
the age of fourteen years the deceased was confirmed as a member of the German
Lutheran church. He continued to be a member until his death. Blessed are the
dead who die in the Lord, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</span> </p>
