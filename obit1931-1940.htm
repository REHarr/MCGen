The brothers and sisters surviving are James Crawford, of <st1:City w:st="on">Estherville</st1:City>,
<st1:State w:st="on">Iowa</st1:State>; Mrs. Lydia Bothwell, of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Formoso</st1:City>,
<st1:State w:st="on">Kansas</st1:State></st1:place>; Dave G. Crawford and Mrs.
William McCue of the home. Two nieces and four nephews also mourn the loss of
their beloved uncle.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Crawford grew to manhood on the farm and during the past
several years was associated with his brother Dave in the firm of Crawford
Bros., dealers in lumber and timber.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Crawford never married and made his home with his
brother and sister after death of his parents. He was industrious and honorable
in his relations with fellowmen and though retiring in disposition those who
knew best respected him most.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At an early age, Mr. Crawford became a member of the
Presbyterian Church Body and was always faithful in his attendance and other
duties therein. At any time and in any way and at any place where service was
needed in his neighborhood, Mr. Crawford was always ready to go and do anything
within his power.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Crawford was seriously ill only a few weeks, from
stomach and intestinal complications and everything possible was done to
restore his health, not only but his loved ones, but by the best of medical
skill and service. He bore his suffering patiently and with a confidence born
of rectitude and faith, his spirit returned to Him who gave it.</span><span

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lawrence Ackerman, age 12, was accidentally struck by an
automobile driven by Arnold Schwall of Woodsfield last Tuesday afternoon. The
accident occurred one mile east of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Lewisville</st1:place></st1:City>
on the Lewisville-Woodsfield road. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Lawrence</st1:place></st1:City>
suffered a fractured skull and crushed chest when he struck the pavement.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Lawrence</st1:place></st1:City>
was coming toward Woodsfield with his little wagon. When he came to the
driveway of a filling station, Mr. Schwall approached him from the rear and
blew his horn. Instead of turning off the main highway into the driveway to let
Mr. Schwall pass, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Lawrence</st1:place></st1:City>
turned directly across the pavement in front of the car. It is believed that he
thought Mr. Schwall wanted to drive into the driveway of the filling station
and turned across the pavement to get out of the way.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Lawrence</st1:place></st1:City>
was removed to a Barnesville hospital where he died early Thursday morning.<br>
