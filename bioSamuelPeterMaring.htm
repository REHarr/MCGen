activity. Since the organization of the Bradley Savings Bank in 1905 he has

October 23, 1858, his father being Samuel Maring, a native of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
 w:st="on">Monroe County</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Ohio</st1:State></st1:place>.
In that district the father of our subject grew to manhood and there married
Alma Hall. About 1850 he and his wife moved to <st1:State w:st="on">Iowa</st1:State>,
among the earliest pioneers in the state, and located in <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Caldwell</st1:PlaceName>
<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Township</st1:PlaceType>, <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Appanoose</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">County</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>,
where Samuel Maring filed on one hundred and sixty acres of land and after
proving his title opened up a farm. He gradually became well known and
prosperous, engaging beside agricultural lines in buying and selling of land.
His first wife passed away during his period of residence here and he later
married Mrs. Julia Van Dyke, a native of Virginia, who was reared and educated
in that state. Samuel Maring died upon the home farm July 11, 1901, having
survived his wife since 1881.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

acquired familiarity with the best methods of farm operation. He aided his
father with the work of the fields until his marriage, which occurred in 1880,
in which year he and his wife commenced their domestic life upon the Maring
homestead, which the subject of this review rented from his father. He later
purchased one hundred and eighty acres and still owns this property, upon which
he has erected a fine residence, a good barn and convenient outbuildings and
installed the necessary farm equipment. The property is made especially
valuable on account of the rich deposits of coal with which a part of it is
underlaid. The Iowa Block Coal Company has sunk a shaft upon the land and has
touched a rich vein from which for the past eight or ten years they have taken
out large quantities of fine coal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

became interested in the town of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Exline</st1:place></st1:City>,
recognizing in its growing prosperity and expansion a good business
opportunity. He purchased a tract of land just adjoining the town, plotted it
as a subdivision, laid out streets and walks, surveyed lots and put them up for
sale. In his promotion of this enterprise he showed his fine business ability
and executive force, for he carried it forward to successful completion, his
addition being now an integral part of the town.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

dwellings rented to tenants, owning besides valuable residence and business
property. When the Bradley Savings Bank was organized in 1905 Mr. Maring was
one of the leading figures in the promotion of the enterprise, of which he was
made manager and cashier. He is thoroughly conversant with the banking business
in principle and in detail and his capable control of the Bradley Savings Bank
is manifested in its growing prosperity It is one of the reliable financial
institutions in this part of the state and conducts all kinds of banking
business.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Maring gives his political allegiance to the Democratic party, with which he
has been affiliated since casting his first vote. He has been elected to a
number of important local positions of trust and honor, in all of which he has
served capably and conscientiously, bending his energies to the promotion of
projects which affect the public growth. He is a member of Exline Lodge, No.
726, I.O.O.F., and he and his wife belong to the Rebekahs. Both are members of
the Christian Church and are well known in the community, their home being the
center of a charming circle of friends. Mr. Maring gives his influence and aid
to progressive public measures and is a stanch supporter of the business,
social and political institutions of the community which he has done so much to
upbuild.</span><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>
