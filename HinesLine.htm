gave her permission to link the information in her e-mail message to her
surname submission with the hope that it might help someone researching this

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>I know that      .. Joseph Hines and his wife
>>>>>>> ef9da23e9f6816b69f175e37096e452723be7711
Elizabeth had 5 daughters, 2 sons. One of the daughters was named Mary or
Martha, perhaps; Joseph the oldest son and Thomas the youngest. I know that
Joseph died right around the time that Thomas was born.1817. I have no idea of
the age of Joseph. Most likely he was older then Elizabeth. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>I also know that there was a John Hines in
Monroe Co. Oh in the 1830 Monroe Co. Oh census Cornelius P. O. Perry Twp. I
have had someone ask about him, and all I have is that census record. That
record says he was between 20-30 and one female same age. They also had 2
slaves. Perhaps he was a brother of the elder Joseph Hines. There was a Joseph
Hines in the Augusta Co. Va. area early on. I also have seen the History of
Monroe Co. Oh by Hardesty, and it says a Joseph Hines named the town of Swazee.
It also said he was buried on the side of the road by the river. That info has
been recited to me by someone related to Joseph Hines, son Joseph and that the
Church was moved from Joseph's land to another spot, I think it was a Methodist
Church (all of this family were Methodist in Spring Hill) but renamed Hines
Chapel Church of Christ, and Joseph was removed to that cemetery. Have you
heard any of that?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt;color:red'><br>
</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>The Hines family was very well known in
the Johnson co./Miami co. Ks. area. <br>
Large land owners, One of Thomas's sons owned the grocery in Spring Hill, <br>
one owned the Pharmacy, one was a Bank officer in the Bank of Spring Hill, <br>
others owned land and a lot of it. Joseph Hines, Thomas's eldest son, owned <br>
land in the thousands of dollars. I don't think Thomas was as wealthy. They <br>
do have a monument stone, over 6 ft. in height, for the listing of all of <br>
Thomas's children, and Joseph's children, where they are both buried. My <br>
father, grandfather, grandmother on both sides are buried in the next row <br>
down from them. My g. grandmother is also buried on the same row, about two <br>
graves from Thomas monument. She died young in 1900 of lung disease. Her <br>
husband my g. grandfather remarried and is buried with his second wife, in <br>
Coffeyville, Ks.</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt'> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
