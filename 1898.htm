membership in the lodge at that place until May 11, 1892, when he was admitted

was a prominent and liberal member of that church. The whole history of his

and children and grandchildren by whom he was surrounded and to whom he was a
most devoted, indulgent and affectionate husband and father.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

inclement, indeed was the night when he was not present at our meetings, if
able to get there. He dearly loved the order, and was respected and loved by
each and every brother who had the honor and pleasure of his acquaintance; and
each and all feel keenly the great loss which our beloved order, the church of
which he was a member, his devoted wife, children and the entire community have
sustained his death; and to the bereaved widow and children we tender our
profoundest sympathy, yet it is consolation to know that as a man and a Mason
his whole life was such that he need not fear death; for him the final summons
brought no dismay, no apprehension,      but surrounded by those he loved and with
a smile upon his countenance, he entered upon the dark voyage so full of
mystery and yet so full of promise and prospect and faith and hope as to banish
all sense of dread from the mind of him upon whose kindling vision the receding
earth was only bringing more clearly into view, the light that shone from the
farther shore, guiding him on the way to his eternal rest in the Celestial
Lodge on high.     <o:p></o:p></span></p>

years ago when he bought property here and became a resident of this
place.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>He was widely known and favorably
known as an honest upright citizen, having established his character early in life
and maintaining it to the end. He was a member of the Presbyterian <span

order at Woodsfield. The funeral services took place Monday; Rev. C. C. B.
Duncan, his pastor, assisted by Rev. Alfred Walls and Rev. W. <span

remains were then placed in charge of the Masonic brethren, who tenderly bore
them to the Buchanan cemetery, where they were buried by the beautiful and
impressive ceremony of that order. A wife and several children are left.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

were cousins. In politics he was a democrat; he cast his first vote for General
Harrison in 1840. Since that time he has been a strong advocate of the
principles of Thomas Jefferson, never failing to attend the presidential, state
and congressional elections. He was born near <st1:City w:st="on">Salem</st1:City>,

1817. He resided on the home farm 33 years. Mr. Ewing was married to Comfort
Snodgrass November 18, 1841. To this union there was born one son and four
daughters of whom one son and three daughters survive him. In 1850 he moved to

home of his son and daughter Mr. And Mrs. Winfield J. <span class=SpellE>Gatchell</span>
of Graysville, October 11. Such a gift had nature in her bounty bestowed on the
subject of this sketch that he was universally loved by all and although his
earthly destiny was sunk to the dust, and his glorious faculties trodden under
earth, yet the full of inborn riches of love to all living will never, never
fade away as long as his acquaintances and friends retain the faculty of
remembrance, until      all should be confined within the bounds which nature hath
assigned.      <o:p></o:p></span></p>

w:st="on">Maryland</st1:State> home to <st1:City w:st="on">Belmont</st1:City>
county where he resided at <span class=SpellE>Lordstown</span> for some time;

county in 1841 and has been a resident here ever since. The family consisted of
3 boys and 6 girls. <span class=GramE>The subject of this sketch being among

there to meet their beloved parents who have gone on before. Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Gatchell</span> became a member of the M. P. Church at an early
age in which church he lived a consistent member until his death. He was a good
man and careful in training his children. He was always at the post of duty in
family career. The recollections of the Graysville citizens of his
susceptibility from the first will abide to the last with them in affection. He
did faithfully whatsoever duties were enjoined upon him in life and retained
his reasoning faculties to the last when he valiantly passed the threshold of
this existence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

class=SpellE>Devaul</span>, who shared his joys and sorrows through the days of
his youth, on toward the autumn of life, but preceded him to the grave June 7,
1891. Mr. <span class=SpellE>Gatchell</span> had been ailing for some weeks but
his friends did not think he was seriously ill, neither was he until a few days
before he expired, when they began to fear that his disease was reaching
dangerous degree. Just before he died he expressed his willingness to go, as
his future prospects were bright. But after it was evident that he must die,
his friends seemed reluctant about giving him up; even knowing that he would be
better off by far than if her was permitted to remain with us. Of course it is
hard to give him up, hard to part with him, knowing that we shall meet him no
more on this side of the grave; but it is consoling to know that if we live a
righteous life we will meet him at God     s right hand in heaven. I can image I
see Grandpa standing just within the pearly gates with his left hand beckoning
us on toward that haven of eternal rest, while his right hand is extended
toward us as if to clasp hands and welcome us home. The funeral <span
class=GramE>services took place from W. J. <span class=SpellE>Gatchell     s</span>
residence at 1 p.m. Wednesday, and was</span> conducted by Rev. John Cooper
assisted by Rev. Palmer. He leaves one son and a host of relatives and friends
to mourn his loss. To him were born two sons, one son ere this has given him a
glorious welcome such as I hope he will be able to give us when we reach the
new Jerusalem.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was done, but of no avail, for the Master had called him home. He was born in
Green <span class=GramE>county</span>, <st1:State w:st="on">Pa.</st1:State>, in

county with his parents when quite small. He has been a citizen of <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Monroe</st1:place></st1:City> county ever since.
He was married to Miss Susannah <span class=SpellE>Conor</span> in 1850. To
this happy union were born seven children, three of whom have gone before him
into the land beyond. At an early age he united with the Methodist church and
has been an earnest and consistent member ever since. Three brothers, a wife
and four children yet remain. A large concourse of friends and relatives
followed his remains to their last resting place. <span class=GramE>Interment

1898, and was interred in the beautiful <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Calais</st1:place></st1:City>
cemetery October 19. The remains were conducted to the M.E. church where Rev. <span

ceremonies in a most elegant address derived from scriptural readings and
examples relative to such a good kindly <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>christian</span></span>
person as the deceased was during the past accountable years of her noble life.
She was a member of the M.E. church and a <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>christian</span></span>
true to the principles of her bible guide. She was always pleasant and kind to
all     either church members or others, and this is true for those who may chance
to read this sketch who knew her will say it is true of Mollie as she was
formerly called by her acquaintances. The deceased was for a long time
afflicted with consumption and an interruption from the consumptive effects of
the bronchial and vocal cords. A large concourse of people attended the funeral
services and reviewed the remains at the church after which many people
repaired with the remains to the cemetery where the deceased has carried out
the scripture <span class=SpellE>injuction</span>:      From dust thou art unto
dust thou shalt return.      At her death bedside, when she expired she was
surrounded by the loving family of the parental household and by mourning
friends; yet she passed from this glorious comfort of friends and has gone to
emulate her career in the eternal space that we may take for one of our true
friends and <span class=SpellE>christian</span> lady <span class=SpellE>examplair</span>
as a future guiding star for our faith and make a hopeful response regarding
duty well performed when it listens in the darkness of the tomb and hears the

in our sadness, farewell.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

came to our quiet village one day last week in the death of C. W. Lowe. He was
a soldier in the late rebellion under the stars and stripes, the loved flag of
his country. He was up in town nearly all forenoon and chatting as lively as
ever with his many friends until he concluded it was time to go home to dinner.
He went home and to the well to get a drink before going into his dinner, but
while at the well he fell dead. On Saturday morning our prominent surgeon G. T.
<span class=SpellE>Snode</span> held a post mortem which revealed the fact that
death was caused by a clogging in the left ventricle of the heart. As a matter
of course his death was instantaneous. He was married to Miss Susanna E. Morris
by Rev. White in November 1856, <span class=GramE>who ,</span> with his entire
family, survive him. He was always a pleasant man in his family and was loved
by them and will be sadly missed. He was a soldier in the late civil war, being
a member of company I, 12<sup>th</sup> regiment <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Ohio</st1:place></st1:State> cavalry. He was reported a brave
soldier. Rev. Williams, pastor of the M. E. Church, conducted the funeral
services at the house, after which the members of the Grand Army of the
Republic took charge and with a host of other friends deposited his remains in
the cemetery.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

one so young, only in the beginning of life, should be called away. But we
ought not to question the Master     s wisdom in removing him from us, for in his

home in <st1:place w:st="on">Stafford</st1:place> October 4, 1898. The deceased
was 26 years and 8 months old. The writer became acquainted with her near two
years ago. She was then an invalid and at times a great sufferer. My first
acquaintance with her impressed me with her <span class=SpellE><span
class=GramE>christian</span></span> character. Though young in <span
class=SpellE><span class=GramE>christian</span></span> experience, her faith
and zeal for God and his cause was clearly marked. Amid her spasms of severe
pain and suffering there were no words of complaint or murmuring against <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Providence</st1:place></st1:City>. But with the
patience of a <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>christian</span></span> of
riper years, she bore it all with a sainted calmness, giving evidence of her
strong trust in her Savior who had said that all things should work together
for good to them that love God. I had the pleasure of visiting her often in her
afflictions, frequently reading to her the promises of God and joining with her
in prayer. These services were a source of great comfort to her. Her responses
during prayer gave evidence that she was living in touch with her Savior and
that her spiritual horizon was clear. As her end was nearing, her faith and
hope of a blessed future seemed to be more intense and stable. She knew she
would soon pass away, yet it gave her no anxious thought for she felt that she
was ready, willing and waiting her Master     s call, come home. Yet if it was the
Lord     s will, she wished to live for the sake of her kind husband who, during
all her prolonged sickness, was when possible, her constant attendant, never
tiring or becoming impatient amid his prolonged watching and care for his
afflicted companion. Her mother, brother and sisters were equally kind and
attentive to poor Jessie, all doing what they could to make her comfortable.
Yet amid the kindness of husband and friends, death came and claimed her for
its victim. She bad them all farewell; said she was going home to Jesus and
asked them to meet her in Heaven. Then fell asleep to Jesus. How blest the
righteous, when they die. Her funeral was preached by Rev. Martin, the present
pastor of <st1:place w:st="on">Stafford</st1:place> charge. After which her body
was laid beneath the sod to await the general resurrection when God shall bid
it rise to enter upon her eternal reward in Heaven.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

uprightness and <span class=SpellE>christian</span> character, and his zealous
attachment to the tenets of Free Masonry, that he was well equipped to give the
important      word      to the <span class=SpellE>Tiler</span> of eternity, and that
he has gone thence to serve and obey the Grand Master of the Universe, who is
our better Master. Brother James Stephens was born March 10, 1827, and died
December 9, 1898, aged 71 years, 8 months and 20 days. He was made a Master
Mason in Monroe Lodge no. 189, F &amp; A M April 13, 1879, and remained a
member thereof until death. He was made a Royal Arch Mason in Woodsfield
Chapter No. 85, R.A.M. December 25, 1882, of which he continued a member until
it surrendered its charter in 1891.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was the cause of his death. The deceased was born in Greene <span class=GramE>county</span>,
<st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pa.</st1:place></st1:State>, March
10, 1827, and died December 9, 1898. He was married in 1850 to Barbara <span

has gone before him into the eternal realms above, and the other still
survives. In 1863 he moved from Green <span class=GramE>county</span>, <st1:State
w:st="on">Pa.</st1:State>, to Wood county, <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">W.Va.</st1:place></st1:State> In 1865 his wife was called from this

 w:st="on">W.Va.</st1:State></st1:place>, and soon afterwards moved to this

he joined the Presbyterian church of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">New

of Christ. He was a member of the Masonic order of Woodsfield. By his death the

and the community a kind and obliging neighbor. The funeral services were
conducted by the Masonic order of Woodsfield assisted by Rev. Cope of <st1:City

Taylor of Altitude. Mr. Taylor had been sick for some time but it was not

nature, his amiable disposition and his love for the sunny side of everything,
made him at once a pleasing companion and called around him many friends. Mr.
Taylor contracted the measles about a year ago, from which he never fully recovered.
The immediate cause of his death however was typhoid fever. He was hopeful to
the last and clung to life with <span class=GramE>a fortitude</span> that was
characteristic of the man. The lines of Mrs. <span class=SpellE>Barbauld</span>
seem appropriate in this connection, only noting the difference, his life was
brief.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

not considered serious until early Tuesday morning when he became unconscious,
suffering from inflammation of the middle ear which affected his brain. His
physician, Dr. T. W. <span class=SpellE>McKelvey</span> of this place, was
summoned and later Dr. <span class=SpellE>Schmied</span> of New <st1:City

daughters, who were all at home when his death occurred except one son and one
daughter. The loss to the family, the church, and humanity in general is a sad
one as he was beloved by all and the relatives have the sympathy of many
friends.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

concerning the death of our friend and neighbor, Mrs. <span class=SpellE>Urana</span>
Workman. She was born September 12, 1851, and departed this life January 6,
1898. Deceased was a daughter of Mr. And Mrs. Jacob <span class=SpellE>Windland</span>.
Her father died when she was very small. Her mother married again and is now
Mrs. Cornelius Knowlton of near Graysville. She leaves one brother, one sister,
and two <span class=SpellE>half sisters</span>; all of whom reside near
Graysville. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>                                     </span>At the age of 17 she was united in marriage to Emmanuel
Christy. To them was born one daughter, Maggie, who stood by her mothers     
beside during her sickness. On October 4, 1870 her husband was called to leave
this world and she was married again to Archibald Workman. To this union was
born eight children, seven boys and one girl; four boys and one girl are still
living.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>                                     </span>Then on October 14, 1888, this father was called to leave
them and since that time she has been the same as father and mother to her
family. She was sick for about four months. She bore her sickness with <span
class=SpellE><span class=GramE>christian</span></span> patience. Everything was
done that could be done to prolong her life but it seemed that her time on
earth was at an end. She was a member of the M. E. Church<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>at</span></span><span

to love her. Thus a loving mother, a kind neighbor and true <span class=SpellE><span
class=GramE>christian</span></span> has left us. But she has gone to that home
above where trouble, pain and sorrow will not grieve her more. She will be
sadly missed by us all, but no place so much as home where her children need a
mother     s guidance. But the one that doeth <span class=SpellE>every thing</span>
for the best will guide and protect them. It is hard to part with those we
love; it is hard to say <span class=SpellE>goodby</span>; but our loss is her
gain. The funeral services were conducted by Rev. Alfred Walls of Woodsfield,
after which the remains were laid to rest in the Moffett cemetery.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
