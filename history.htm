<p style='margin-left:1.0in'><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>When Juanita
Rosenlieb attended an Ohio Genealogical Society mini-convention at Salt Fork
State Park in 1984, officers of the OGS asked her for help. They expressed
their desire to see an OGS chapter in Monroe County. Juanita helped organize a
meeting in Antioch in August 1984. In accordance with the wishes of some at the
meeting, the chapter was made a department of the Monroe County Historical
Society. In September 1984, the first meeting of the Monroe County Chapter of
the Ohio Genealogical Society was held. Juanita Rosenlieb served as the first
president. Other officers included: Vice President Gloria Whittaker, Secretary
Mildred Mellott, Newsletter Editor Karen Romick, Query Editor Shirley

newsletter was expanded to a quarterly newsletter called <i>The Heritage</i>. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>By 1988 members
of the Monroe Chapter agreed that in order for the chapter to realize its
fullest potential, it would be necessary to become an independent organization.
At a meeting held May 1, 1988, it was decided to separate from the Historical
Society. The formation of the independent group was sanctioned by the state
organization, the Ohio Genealogical Society.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>With the
support of its members, the Monroe Chapter has grown steadily and strongly since
that time. Working toward its goal of promoting and preserving genealogical
data, the chapter has worked diligently at publishing materials and building
the resources of the Research Room.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>A 24-page
quarterly newsletter, <i>The Navigator</i>, is published in January, April,
July and October. An annual index is published in December. The <i>Navigator</i>
has been honored for excellence by the OGS in its annual newsletter
competition. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>The chapter has
also published books to make local genealogical records available to
researchers. In 1992, the chapter published <i>Monroe County, Ohio Families</i>.
This volume was a biographical history of Monroe County. It was the first and
only one of its kind ever done on Monroe County.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>The chapter
also maintains the Research Room for Local History and Genealogy at the Monroe
County District Library. The chapter has purchased books, periodicals,
microfilm, microfiche and CD-ROMs for the room. In addition, the chapter has
received many donations (most notably of family histories) from its members.
The chapter has also implemented a long-term project to hard bind all the items
in the room. With the donations of members, the chapter has accomplished much
of this goal. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>The chapter is
involved in several long-term projects. One project is the publication of the
works of Catharine F. Fedorchak. Mrs. Fedorchak was the foremost genealogist in
Monroe County. For over 40 years, she collected genealogical data throughout
Monroe County. Following her death, the Monroe Chapter was given exclusive
permission to reprint her works. Although she published a newspaper column for
a Monroe County paper, the bulk of her work has never been published and has
not been available to the general public until now. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>Another project
is the copying of cemetery inscriptions in Monroe County. Hoping to eventually
publish all cemeteries in Monroe County, the chapter is working at this
valuable and difficult task. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>The Monroe
Chapter will continue to work toward the accomplishment of their goals and
welcomes you to join their effort to preserve the genealogical history of
Monroe County. </span></b><span style='font-family:Arial'><o:p></o:p></span></p>
