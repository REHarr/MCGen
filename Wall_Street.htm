<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>BEALLSVILLE,
Ohio       six young men from this town died fighting in the Vietnam War.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>That statistic put Beallsville, population
475, in the history books as the America town that suffered more losses per
capita than any other during that war.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">    
</span>Children here are taught the names of those victims not long after they
start school.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>     We     re proud to
be what?      Pat Marcum asked her kindergarten students.<span style="mso-spacerun:

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>So much
suffering might turn some communities against war, or at least against military
service.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>But not this one.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>About 100 Monroe County residents are on active
military duty today, a rate of service that is about one-third higher than
national average.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>Some students at
Beallsville High School say the looming battle with Iraq makes them more
inclined to choose the military over college.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>     My three uncles
and my grandfather all fought in wars.      Says 18-year-old Tyler Brown, a
high-school senior who is considering enlistment.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">     </span>     It would give me a sense of pride.     <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>The nation     s
smallest and poorest communities have long sent a disproportionate number of
soldiers to war.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>In World War II and
Vietnam, the draft gave most young men little choice.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">     </span>Even in 1991, at the time of the Gulf War, young people in Monroe
County had few options.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>Jobs were
scarce and college was expensive.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>But since then,
a new coal mine has opened and the retail job market has improved in
surrounding counties.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>As a result, the
unemployment rate has dropped to 8% from 12%.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">    
</span>Belmont Technical College, a 45-minute drive from Beallsville, has begun
offering two years of free tuition to Monroe County high-school graduates.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>Opportunities have never been greater, yet
military recruiting here hasn     t suffered.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>     I think it     s
the way we     re brought up,      says Sgt. Rusty Lucas, an Army recruiter whose
cousin was one of the Beallsville men killed in Vietnam.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">         </span>     The people here understand that sometimes
a sacrifice has to be made.     <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Monroe County
sits near the border with West Virginia, where trucks hauling coal and steel
rumble along narrow mountain roads.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">    
</span>Half of all adults in this primarily white community lack high-school
diplomas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>Only 15% go to college.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>The median family income, at $30,000, is
almost $12,000 less than the national average.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">    
</span>The county has 11,600 adults, and about 2,000 of them       or 17% -- are
veterans.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>Nationwide, veterans
constitute 13% of the adult population.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Other subtle
factors contribute to the area     s high rate of military service.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>The American Legion post in Beallsville,
which has a freshly painted tank on its lawn, hosts Easter-egg hunts for local
children, sponsors Little League baseball teams, provides coats and shoes for
local children who can     t afford them, and grants college scholarships every
year to high-school seniors.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Three times a
year veterans from Legion Post 768 put on their uniforms and visit Beallsville
Elementary School and Beallsville High School to talk to students about
military service.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>Students take field
trips to Veterans Memorial Park, where a bronze marker lists the names of the
six men from Beallsville and the five from other towns in Monroe County who died
in Vietnam.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>(Monroe County lost 52 men
in World War II, and three in Korea.) The cemetery where some of the men are
buried is on a hill next to the school.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>When
Beallsville     s Vietnam veterans came home, they heard that soldiers from other
towns felt unappreciated, that some were ashamed to wear uniforms in
public.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>Here the welcome was warm.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>Some Beallsville residents opposed the war
in Vietnam, just as some oppose the war in Iraq, but no one questioned the
honor of those who served<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>I     d probably go
in again,      says Dave Wier, 60, a Vietnam veteran, as he sat one morning at the
Legion post, sipping coffee from a Styrofoam cup.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">     </span>     It     s the best thing a kid can do coming out of high school.     
Says his fellow veteran, David Morris, also 60.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>As other
communities around the country began organizing antiwar protests last year,
Monroe County staged a rally in support of the men and women in the armed
services.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>On Nov. 4, more than 500
people packed the town square in Woodsfield, by the county courthouse.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Fourteen fire
trucks, two marching bands, dozens of Boy Scouts and members of two American
Legion and two VFW posts paraded through town.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">    
</span>Police barred traffic from the streets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">    
</span>Local resident Dorothy Ricer read a poem she wrote, that included these
lines:      Now our children, husbands, wives must pay a price so steep/To stop
these monsters in their tracks so may freedom keep.     <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Relatives of
those serving the armed forces put flags in front of the courthouse, one for
each soldier, Joy Dillon, 43, planted flags on behalf of her sons, who are both
in the Army.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>Matt. 25, is in Kuwait,
Corey, 22, is in Fort Riley, Kan., and expects to leave any day for the Middle
East.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>When Mrs. Dillon
Graduated from high school in 1977, she says,      it wasn     t cool to go into the
service.     <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>Young men in Beallsville
didn     t wear long hair in the      70s, she says, but they get      a little
shaggy.     <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>Military recruiting, at that
time, was less aggressive because the armed forces were trying to get leaner.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>But when her
children were old enough to join, Mrs. Dillon wasn     t surprised by their
interest in becoming soldiers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>     It     s
not like they had nothing else to do or couldn     t get a job,      she sys.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>     In this area, it     s a highly regarded
thing.     <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Correy Dillon
studied welding in high school and wanted to become a machinist when he
graduated in 1999.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>He could have gone
to college, he says, but Army recruiters told him he could learn the skills in
the service without paying tuition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>His
choice was mostly pragmatic, he says, but he also reflected on Beallsville     s
losses in Vietnam as he made his decision.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>     The veterans
around Beallsville are real good with younger kids about telling them how they
felt back then,       Mr. Dillon, an Army specialist, says.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>     They went into the military to do a job and
they did it honorably.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>Somebody     s got
to do that.     <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>After the
terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, Mr. Dillon says it became clear
he might be thrust into combat.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>     Anxious, sir,     
he says, when asked to describe how he feels about approaching conflict.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>     Nobody wants to go.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>But if I     ve got to go, I     m ready.     <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Many people in
Beallsville share Mr. Dillon     s ambivalence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">    
</span>They would prefer not to see a war, but they will support the effort
once it begins.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>     In 1990, I was
behind them all the way,       says Roger Schnegg, 50, an electrician who works in
the coal mine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>His brother Charles was
killed in Vietnam.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>     This time I     m kind
of mixed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>We dragged it out and now the
U.N     s not behind us.     <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>More opposed is
Blade Lucas, 18, a senior and distant cousin of Bobby Lucas, who was killed by
a sniper in Vietnam.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>     I don     t think the
war that     s brewing is just,      he says.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">    
</span>     I     d have to be drafted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>It     s
the only way I     d go.     <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Toni Kanzigg was
16 when Bobby Lucas, her brother, was killed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">    
</span>Five years later, another one of her brothers enlisted in the
Marines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>More than two decades later,
her oldest son enlisted in the Army.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Mrs Kanzigg, now
50, says the young people of Beallsville, and their parents, can     t help but
think of Vietnam when they enlisted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">    
</span>     I     m sure they think about how many got killed and they know it could
happen to them.      She says.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>     But we have
to have our freedom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>They go
willingly.     <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Her son, Baron
Trigg, suffered a moment of doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>The
Gulf War began after he     d signed up, but before he     d started basic
training.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>He asked his mother to help
him get out of his commitment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>Mrs.
Kanazig refused.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>     You can     t make a
choice and then take the easy way out,      she recalls telling him.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>     I didn     t want

children, and works in a coal mine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>     It
straightened me out.     <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Though, the
military continues to attract young people here, most of Beallsville     s
high-school seniors say college is their first choice.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>Because of grants and loans available today,
     It     s much easier for them to go to college than it was for my generation,     
says Delmas Moore, 54, who teaches social studies at Beallsville High School.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>But, some
high-school seniors say that since Sept. 11, they     ve started thinking that the
country needs defending and that it might need more soldiers.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>     I     d be more likely to join if we were
actually at war,      says Antony Erchak, a 17-year old senior.<span
