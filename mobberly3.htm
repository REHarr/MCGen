Notes for THOMAS FRANKLIN GREEN:<br>
Thomas F. Green was a tall thin, rather stern looking man whom I barely
remember.&nbsp; However, my Mother told me that he was stern in looks
only.&nbsp; She remembered picking strawberries at his house under the really
stern nose of his second wife whom Mother disliked immensely as a child.&nbsp;
The second Mrs. Green was a Mobberly, but not directly related to our line of
Mobberlys allied to the family.&nbsp; If her Grandfather was overseeing the
grandchildren picking berries, they were allowed and indeed encouraged to eat some
as they picked.&nbsp; Not so, if the Grandmother was in charge.&nbsp; Fingers
were slapped if they were caught.&nbsp; (Of course, they never knew their
biological Grandmother, Nancy Ellen Nicholson, because she died shortly after
the birth of her last child when my Grandpa was just a young man.)<br>
<br>
I personally have three memories of this gentleman.&nbsp; I remember visiting
his house in Rushville where he had a glider-type ourdoor furniture item which
fascinated me.&nbsp; It took two people, one on each side, opposite each other
to make it work.&nbsp; Whey my Great Uncle Pearl, Thomas F. Green's youngest
son and my Grandpa's brother, was there he had a daughter by adoption named
June Rose.&nbsp; We were near the same age and spent many hours making good use
of this swing type apparatus.<br>
<br>
Mysecond memory is of an old pump organ in the house.&nbsp; I remember his wife
being rather grouchy when I wanted to &quot;play&quot; the organ.&nbsp; Usually
my Grandpa would chord on it and that would satisfy me.&nbsp; It took both feet
pumping air into the bellows which resulted in a rather wheezy sound in order
to play the instrument but it was music and that was all I wanted.&nbsp; Years
later I was to learn how much coordination it truly took to play such an
instrument.<br>
<br>
My last memory of this place and time is the funeral of T.F. Green.&nbsp; Since
I was almost eight years old, I don't know why but my Mother did not want me to
attend the service.&nbsp; It was early December and rather chilly in the car,
but there I remained until everyone filed out of the small church on the curve
in Rushville just above where Grandpa Green owned a house at that time.&nbsp;
Both buildings are now gone.<br>

<br>
Notes for THOMAS FRANKLIN GREEN:<br>
Thomas F. Green was a tall thin, rather stern looking man whom I barely
remember.&nbsp; However, my Mother told me that he was stern in looks
only.&nbsp; She remembered picking strawberries at his house under the really
stern nose of his second wife whom Mother disliked immensely as a child.&nbsp;
The second Mrs. Green was a Mobberly, but not directly related to our line of
Mobberlys allied to the family.&nbsp; If her Grandfather was overseeing the
grandchildren picking berries, they were allowed and indeed encouraged to eat
some as they picked.&nbsp; Not so, if the Grandmother was in charge.&nbsp;
Fingers were slapped if they were caught.&nbsp; (Of course, they never knew
their biological Grandmother, Nancy Ellen Nicholson, because she died shortly
after the birth of her last child when my Grandpa was just a young man.)<br>
<br>
I personally have three memories of this gentleman.&nbsp; I remember visiting
his house in Rushville where he had a glider-type ourdoor furniture item which
fascinated me.&nbsp; It took two people, one on each side, opposite each other
to make it work.&nbsp; Whey my Great Uncle Pearl, Thomas F. Green's youngest
son and my Grandpa's brother, was there he had a daughter by adoption named
June Rose.&nbsp; We were near the same age and spent many hours making good use
of this swing type apparatus.<br>
<br>
Mysecond memory is of an old pump organ in the house.&nbsp; I remember his wife
being rather grouchy when I wanted to &quot;play&quot; the organ.&nbsp; Usually
my Grandpa would chord on it and that would satisfy me.&nbsp; It took both feet
pumping air into the bellows which resulted in a rather wheezy sound in order
to play the instrument but it was music and that was all I wanted.&nbsp; Years
later I was to learn how much coordination it truly took to play such an
instrument.<br>
<br>
My last memory of this place and time is the funeral of T.F. Green.&nbsp; Since
I was almost eight years old, I don't know why but my Mother did not want me to
attend the service.&nbsp; It was early December and rather chilly in the car,
but there I remained until everyone filed out of the small church on the curve
in Rushville just above where Grandpa Green owned a house at that time.&nbsp;
Both buildings are now gone.<br>

Notes for JAMES FRANKLIN GREEN:<br>
James Franklin Green, my Grandpa, in addition to being a colorful personality
was an intelligent man.&nbsp; He had a love for life and family; he loved to
tease; and he was a truly resourceful person.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since I was the first
granddaughter in the family on either side, he would have loved to spoil me
rotten.&nbsp; In addition, they lived in the same house with us quite often
during the Depression years so he had more opportunity to carry out his
indulgences than most grandparents experience.<br>
<br>
Before I was four, we all lived in Jeromesville, Ohio on North Main St. and
Grandpa and Pop would go to work together and return in the early
afternoon.&nbsp; Grandpa was up with the birds and liked getting his work done
early so that he could enjoy his favorite sport, baseball games on the
radio.&nbsp; Somehow, since I didn't yet read a clock, I seemed to know just
when to position myself at the back of the yard where I could see the orange
Ohio Fuel Gas Company truck coming up the back alley.&nbsp; For some strange
reason, I always wanted to take a walk which was not a favorite activity at any
other time.&nbsp; Grandpa would play along with my request, but&nbsp; he would
try to get me to go a different direction from time to time.&nbsp; However, I
was always insistent on going down the alley toward's Rowe's Drug Store which
just happened to sell ice cream cones.&nbsp; I would laboriously listen to all
of the flavors available and then nearly always come out with chocolate! <br>
<br>
&nbsp;It was about this time that I got nosey with Grandma's kitchen stove and
turned on all of the burners.&nbsp; When the explosion finally occurred, guess
who lost her eyebrows and made a fast get away?&nbsp; I remember meeting my
Mother in the doorway trying to find out&nbsp; the cause of the loud noise.&nbsp;
It was not long after that that we moved back to Rushville to Grandpa's house
because Pop was laid off again during the Depression.&nbsp; By the time I was
to start first grade we were back in town living in the Noggle House on South
Main St.<br>
<br>
I do not remember exactly how many times we moved into Jeromesville and out
again but I am certain of at least three different moves and five houses,
always in the same village.&nbsp; The work of cleaning out wells for the Gas
Co. was around Ashland County and we seemed to always end up back in
town.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
We moved back to Rushville to Grandpa's house when Pop was laid off during the
second half of my first grade.&nbsp; My Mother, Grandmother Green and I were
the last to leave town on moving day.&nbsp; The delay was caused by Mother's
cat sensing something was going on and jumping through the glass in the kitchen
door.&nbsp; Since Grandma was holding the cat, she got cut on the glass and we
had to go see Dr. Lewis in town to get her arm stitched before we could leave. <br>
<br>
Near Mt. Vernon, Mother stopped the car because the moving van with all of her
earthly possessions was jacknifed in the middle of a hill due to ice on the
road.&nbsp; We went on around, in time, and the next morning the van had
arrived in Rushville, but the van was tilting toward one side, having broken an
axle just as the driver negotiated the bottom of the hill where Grandpa and
Grandma lived.<br>
<br>
Later that winter, Grandpa was called back to work up north, but Pop went to
work for the State of Ohio.&nbsp; So back to Jeromesville went the
Greens.&nbsp; This time they lived above the Volunteer Grocery Store.&nbsp;
Whenever we would go visit my Grandparents, I would spend hours with an old
viewer which used double pictures on long postcard material and I became
acquainted with many places and things of which I had never heard.&nbsp;
Primary in my memory is Niagara Falls.&nbsp; Grandpa also introduced me to the
Bible about this time.&nbsp; We had&nbsp; moved on to Pleasantville, just down
the road from my Great Uncle Will, Grandpa's brother, where&nbsp; I attended
second grade.<br>
<br>
During the early summer before my third grade, the Gas Co. Superintendent came
down to Pleasantville personally to convince my Pop that we should move back to
northern Ohio and that he should work for the Ohio Fuel once again.&nbsp; That
was the final lay off.&nbsp; I started third grade at Jeromesville and stayed
until midway through the fifth grade.&nbsp; We lived in the big white house in
front of the feed mill at the bottom of South Main St. <br>
<br>
During this time, my Grandparents lived in an older home up on North Main&nbsp;
and Grandpa once again brought out the&nbsp; Bible stories whenever I could go
visit.&nbsp; I remember both of us getting sick from eating too many English
Walnuts one Saturday morning&nbsp; while he looked at and read from the old
Family Bible.&nbsp; I had many questions for him which he always patiently
answered.<br>
<br>
This set of Grandparents would take me with them to Monroe County for overnight
trips.&nbsp; I remember serenading them all the way one warm summer day as I
occupied my favorite spot right between the two of them in the front
seat.&nbsp; We stopped in Woodsfield for something cold to drink.&nbsp; Perhaps
he thought that if I had something to drink, I couldn't sing anymore.<br>
<br>
I remember going to church with them many times.&nbsp; Once during the winter
at Widowville, it was so cold I thought I would freeze.&nbsp; I know now that
the church had no heat.&nbsp; Today, there is nothing there but a small
cemetery.&nbsp; We were staying with Oat and Belle Echelbarger during this time
waiting for the Noggle House to be made ready for us to rent.&nbsp; I attended
church with them many times in Ashland after they moved to East Liberty
Street.&nbsp; They always attended the Christian Church which did not allow
instrumental music.&nbsp; No organ nor piano!&nbsp; The song leader would get
up in front and pitch the song about right and everyone would start with
him.&nbsp; Such beautiful four part harmony you never heard.&nbsp; Grandpa
loved to hear me play the piano in the years to come when I studied and he
would sit by the hour and listen, but he believed that such sounds were to be
heard elsewhere than in the House of God.<br>
<br>
Grandpa retired during the time they lived in Ashland but he was always busy
doing something.&nbsp; My younger memories always included his ownership of a
new or nearly new car.&nbsp; I don't know how he could afford it but he usually
managed to have the latest model.&nbsp; He found a house down the street and
was about to move there when on a Saturday evening during which time I was
there, he suffered his first stroke.&nbsp; It effected his speech for a short
period of time but it wasn't long before he was back up walking with only a
slight impediment to his gait.&nbsp; Industrious as he was, he had rigged up a
small hook on the end of his right shoe&nbsp; and attached&nbsp; a long spring
to hold in his right hand.&nbsp; Then, he could walk and give that foot a slight
tug so that his walk was almost normal. He also taught himself to write with
his left hand and he made pot holders in a hand held loom by the hundreds
and&nbsp; I still have one.<br>
<br>
Having a stroke didn't slow him down very much.&nbsp; Somehow or another, he
managed to get down to the dug out area which was all of the basement the house
had and enlarged the area to a full basement.&nbsp; He would dig by hand, load
the buckets and haul all of it out to the back yard.&nbsp; Then he sealed it
and painted it a pale yellow.&nbsp; He wanted a dry area for storage and he
made one.&nbsp; Like I said, he was resourceful.<br>
<br>
The next stroke took a greater toll.&nbsp; This time there would be no more
walking and he was confined to a wheel chair.&nbsp; His recuperation was spent
at our house on Grant St. wher, for the last time, the two families lived
together. I was dating by this time, and I always had to go in and get his
approval before I left.&nbsp; The boyfriend and future husband had to come
upstairs and talk with him before we could leave.&nbsp; He retained a sharp
mind and remembered everything right up until his last illness.<br>
<br>
He could get himself in and out of bed, around the house, onto the porch and
attend to his personal needs.&nbsp; In the days before medicine for high blood
pressure, his veins and arteries were seriously damaged.&nbsp; He would lose
his temper at Grandma and tell her to be quiet.&nbsp; He did not have the
patience I had known as a youngster but he was still loving toward me and my
friends who loved to go visit with him.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
I stayed with them the fall of 1950 shortly before my marriage and he really
enjoyed having me around.&nbsp; I was working at J.C. Penneys and he would want
me to sit down and tell him everything that happened every day.&nbsp; He would
tell Grandma exactly what &quot;we&quot; wanted to eat that evening, and
Grandma, who was an excellent cook, would cook up a storm.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
before I knew what was going on, I had put on about ten pounds.&nbsp; Grandpa
loved fried dressing which Grandma always fixed in an iron skillet.&nbsp; She
would brown it well and we would enjoy.&nbsp; More calories than I was used to
eating.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;He had loved to put my firstborn, Bill, on the tray of his wheelchair and
take him around over the room but a final illness came.&nbsp;&nbsp; I stayed
through the night with him because Grandma needed to rest and he talked till
late about his days of drilling for oil in Texas and about the huge turtles and
rattlesnakes they used to see around the wells.&nbsp; He was delerious that
night and talked in his sleep while he relived those days of his youth and
accomplishments.<br>
<br>
<br>
Grandpa was the first of his family to go.&nbsp; I was ready to leave for the
hospital to see him, when I was called that he had expired in June, 1953.&nbsp;
Since I had just talked with him that morning and he was expecting my visit, it
was quite a shock.&nbsp; Needless to say, the loss of this first grandparent
left a huge void in my life.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; While Grandma was kind and loving toward me, she never showed any
partial feelings toward one grandchild over another.&nbsp; However, with
Grandpa Green, there had never been any doubt that I was one of his favorites,
mainly because he got to spend more time with me that those grandchildren in
Michigan.&nbsp; When Grandparents lived with your family during these years
when every penny counted so much, a close relationship developed which could
not be matched with short visits.&nbsp; My life was truly enriched by our
sharing homes for so many years. <br>

Notes for NORA ORANGE:<br>
Grandma Green was a quiet woman who tolerated Grandpa's impatience following
his strokes.&nbsp; I stayed w/ them for about three months just shortly before
I got married so I had an opportunity to see their relationship in greater
detail.&nbsp; She loved Grandpa w/ fiber of her body, and was so grief stricken
at his funeral that I feared she would expire herself.&nbsp; Grandma had been a
very attractive woman in her young days and I have photos which I want to add
to this record to prove my point.&nbsp; I always knew that my brother, J.R.,
was closer to her than I was because he was her first and only grandchild for
several years.&nbsp; Mom had told me of many family tales involving Grandma and
J.R. which demonstrated their closeness.&nbsp; In fact, one incident was that
when I was born, J.R. went to stay w/ Grandma.&nbsp; When she brought him back
home to see his new sister, he told Grandma that he wanted the nurse to take me
back, he wanted a baby brother instead!<br>
<br>
Grandma was not a fancy cook, but she was an excellent cook.&nbsp; One of her
favorite dishes to prepare was a favorite of Grandpa's and mine when I was staying
there w/ them in Ashland in the fall of 1950.&nbsp; She made bread dressing w/
a great amound of onions in a big iron skillet which allowed the dressing to
brown all over and be moist and tasty on the inside.&nbsp; I wish I had paid
more attention to what she was doing because I would like to be able to
duplicate what she did.&nbsp; To my knowledge, she &quot;baked&quot; this on
top of the stove, covered, instead of baking it in the oven.&nbsp; I know that
Grandpa and I both started gaining weight from eating dressing too often.<br>
<br>
Grandma made good fruit pies also.&nbsp; I really don't remember any other
specialities of hers but I remember going to pick raspberries w/ her when I was
only three or four.&nbsp; I know that I was not yet reading because Grandma got
stung by a bee and sent me back to the house to get the baking soda.&nbsp; I
distinctly remember looking at both the baking powder and soda and not knowing
which one she wanted.&nbsp; I think I took the wrong one and had to go back to
the house again while she waited out in the field w/ a bad sting.&nbsp; Knowing
her, she probably went on picking while she waited.<br>
<br>
I remember that Grandma worked slowly but efficiently.&nbsp; She would be all
day cleaning house; but her house was always spotless.&nbsp; She seemed to take
a long time to cook a meal, but it would all be tasty when she finished.&nbsp;
I never knew her to be impatient w/ a grandchild and she showed remarkable
restraint when Grandpa would lose his patience if she didn't understand what he
wanted.&nbsp; After his second stroke, he was more difficult to understand and
he would become so angry that the veins at his temples would stand out.&nbsp;
Grandma would just quietly go on doing what she was doing and try to appease
his anxiety.<br>
<br>
She was a strong Christian woman who attended church faithfully.&nbsp; I have a
couple of her hymnals in which she wrote her name and circled favorites.&nbsp;
Her family was musical and she had a brother who wrote hymns.&nbsp; I have
looked through all of my old music but I have never found any of his
work.&nbsp; The family always sang in harmony and I am certain that my Mother
achieved her skill at singing in harmony by listening to Grandma and her
sisters sing when she was young.&nbsp; I know I picked up the art by listening
to Mom before I started the study of music. <br>

Great Aunt Mary was probably the best known to me of all of Grandpa Green's
siblings.&nbsp; She came to my grandparents and stayed quite often in her older
years and was there when I stayed while my parents traveled to Texas to see my
brother during World War II.&nbsp; She had a unique walk which I now recognize as
one caused by arthritic hip joints, since I also have a problem with arthritis,
but at the time I could not understand why she &quot;waddled&quot; when she
walked.&nbsp; She was always friendly to me and I remember her snowy white
hair.&nbsp; I have a picture taken with her in front of my grandparents' home.<br>

58.&nbsp; PEARLY RAYMOND7 GREEN (THOMAS FRANKLIN6, ISAAC TIMOTHY5, CATHARINE4
MOBBERLY, WILLIAM3, THOMAS2, JOHN1)113 was born November 29, 1895, and died
November 13, 1962 in Michigan114.&nbsp; He married FREDA GRAY115 December 10,
1921 in Monroe Co., Ohio by J. F. Clifton, J. P.116, daughter of JOHN GRAY and

<br>
Notes for PEARLY RAYMOND GREEN:<br>
I remember Uncle Pearl as a big man who wheezed due to having been gassed
during World War I.&nbsp; My Mother told me that when he was in Europe in the
war, he sought safety in the bell tower of a church during a battle.&nbsp;
While he was hiding there, he heard another person seeking the same
haven.&nbsp; Neither man spoke for awhile but at some point they each became
aware that the other was one of the enemy.&nbsp; Somehow they agreed not to
disagree and each left without harming the other when it was safe to leave.<br>
His youngest daughter, June Rose, whom I have not seen since we were young
children, was one of the few girl relatives I had with whom I could play.&nbsp;
We used to swing together in the front yard of our great grandfather, Thomas
Franklin Green, shortly before he died in East Rushville, Ohio.&nbsp; I have a
snapshot taken of the two of us in that yard.<br>

At the time of his marriage to Freda, they were living in Junction City, Perry
CO., OH.&nbsp; This was a center at that time for oil wells and that was his
type of work.[PO New FTW Family File GEDC.FTW]<br>

Notes for FLORA MILDRED GREEN:<br>
For some reason that I never understood, my Mother called her Aunt Mildred,
Aunt Mug.&nbsp; The nickname stuck and other family members used this handle
for her also.&nbsp; She was a beautiful lady and of course the youngest of her
family.&nbsp; Her mother, Nancy Ellen Nicholson Green, had died when she was a
baby so Aunt Mug was raised by her sisters.&nbsp; We did not see this aunt as often
because they lived out of state but I remember her distinctly at the Green
Reunions held at Mt. Pleasant, a park in Lancaster, Ohio always held on the 4th
of July.<br>

<br>
Notes for ELMA ARMETA GREEN:<br>
During the summer of 2001, I hosted a gathering of PETTY researchers in Perry
Co. and in Mansfield, OH at my home.&nbsp; Enroute to the Joseph Petty farm, I
stopped to visit w/ Armeta at the Nursing Home Facility in Somerset.&nbsp; She
looked up as I entered the room and smiled.&nbsp; I asked her if she recognized
me.&nbsp; She said,&nbsp; &quot;Well, I know that you look just like someone
who is no longer w/ us, (meaning my Mother) so i reckon you must be Margie
Ann.&quot;&nbsp; I had not seen her for many years although we had in contact
quite often when I was in college at Ashland during the 1960s. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
Armeta cooked in the cafeteria at the college, so whenever I had to stay over
for a class, I would eat at the cafeteria and visit w/ her.&nbsp; Shortly after
that, she and Dwight moved to AZ because of her arthritis condition.&nbsp; She
was suffering a great deal when I saw her at the cafeteria and I knew they were
considering moving to warmer climate.&nbsp; She had rheumatoid arthritis which
appears to have been handed down in great amounts to the GREEN descendants
including myself, my youngest son, and perhaps one of my daughters.&nbsp; My
son, Bill, has a great deal of osteoarthritis but at this point has not shown
signs of rheumatoid.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
I have acquired her youngest child, Tommy, address and telephone number.&nbsp;
I am going to attempt to get in touch w/ him especially to share this family
history w/ him.<br>

Notes for LAURIE STEWART:<br>
At this point in the history of the Green Family, I would like to add an
article I have written and am in the process of submitting for publication w/
Guideposts Publication.&nbsp; Since Laurie's death was the impetus for the
experience I had at that time, it seems fitting that I should submit it here w/
the information about Laurie Stewart. <br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
THE DAY THE ANGELS SANG<br>
<br>
I was fifteen, it was the coldest winter I can ever remember, and my Mother was
taking the two of us to Southern Ohio where we were to attend the funeral of my
cousin, Laurie.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mom had told me ahead that Laurie had had a disease
as a child which would not allow her to reach maturity.&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe
that it was rheumatic fever but I am not sure and it is not
important.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had spent the preceding July 4th with Laurie at a
Family Reunion, so accepting the fact that she was gone and that there would
never be another sunny, summer afternoon with Laurie was difficult for me to
comprehend.&nbsp;&nbsp; I rode along quietly, with many questions in my mind.<br>
<br>
When we arrived at the old farmhouse, where I had spent so many happy hours
with my cousin, the snow crunched loudly under our feet as we unloaded our
luggage, and the foyer was as cold as the outdoors.&nbsp; My &quot;young, proof
by scientific methods only mind,&quot; was having problems accepting that we
were going inside and dealing with something that was totally strange and
unknown to me.&nbsp;&nbsp; There had been other deaths in the family, but I had
never been allowed to attend the funerals nor view the bodies.&nbsp;&nbsp; My
Mother had shielded me from those experiences.&nbsp;&nbsp; Though I had
discussed my confusion with no one, I had many concerns over what had happened
to Laurie.&nbsp; Where had she gone?<br>
The house was a typical old farmhouse with doorways leading many directions,
all doors closed to conserve heat in the portion of the house where the family
was gathered.&nbsp;&nbsp; As we entered the parlor, I was shocked to see a
casket in the next room.&nbsp; Eventually, as a group, we moved toward the other
room where I looked upon the physical shell of my beloved Laurie.&nbsp;&nbsp; I
remember nothing further about the conversations taking place at that
time.&nbsp;&nbsp; I just remember staring at Laurie.<br>
<br>
Finally, it came to me that I was alone in the room with Laurie and I felt the
compulsion to approach the casket and look more closely at this first
experience with death.&nbsp;&nbsp; I reached out, tears streaming down my face,
and touched her cheek.&nbsp;&nbsp; As I did, I felt a powerful surge through my
entire body, much like an electric shock I think, except that there was no pain
involved. Then, the Angels began to sing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Music, the likes of
which, I had never heard before nor since, began to resound throughout the
room.&nbsp;&nbsp; There were thousands of voices, all singing words I cannot
identify in melodies I cannot repeat. I remember looking up to my right above
the window for the source of the sound. It was music, not of this world, and
totally unlike any I had studied for the past six years as a budding pianist
and beginning vocal student.<br>
<br>
As I remained, touching Laurie's cheek, with the sounds of this glorious music
filling my heart, God spoke to me.&nbsp;&nbsp; He did not call my name. He just
spoke to me and reassured me that the concerns I had about where Laurie had
gone would be all right.&nbsp;&nbsp; He told me that Laurie was with Him and
that I would be all right, also.&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, he took the pain out of
my heart. I have no idea how long I remained there nor how long I spent in
Communion with God. It was a unique moment spent with My Maker which will never
be repeated in this lifetime, but I know that it will resume on that day when I
join Him in the life to come.&nbsp; Eventually, I joined the rest of the family
in the big old kitchen; but I volunteered nothing to anyone, not then, not
later.<br>
<br>
In reflection, I do not think I truly realized the depth of what had happened
to me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had not been reared in a home where God was discussed and
church was regularly attended.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was not discouraged from attending
Sunday school with my best friend, nor was I encouraged.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;
we attended her church and sang in the choir under the same director who taught
us at school.&nbsp; Through my love of music and my willingness to attend
church with her, I had been exposed to enough of the Bible to appreciate what
had happened to me. Upon my return home, I shared my experience with this same
friend who stopped dead still in her tracks when I described what had
happened.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was she who explained and confirmed what I had already
deducted had been a metaphysical experience.<br>
<br>
I shared this with no one else until I had married and had children of my own
and during their early teens I found a time when it appeared to be appropriate
to discuss my experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since that time, I have shared the story
whenever I felt that the listener would benefit from my little
story.&nbsp;&nbsp; I firmly believe that I was able to instill a strong
Christian belief in each of my children, in addition to many whom I have taught
since then, because there was no doubt, ever, in my mind about the existence of
God. I know that God is because I have heard the Angels sing.&nbsp; Those
people, with whom I shared the story, trusted me enough to know that I would
never lie to them.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<br>
Since entering my twilight years on this earth, I have wondered so many times
why God used me, an above average, but certainly not brilliant student, whose
future looked pretty dim at that time because in two years I would be married
and soon afterwards Mothering four small children.&nbsp; It would be a long
time before the seed He had planted would prosper and grow.&nbsp; I was
certainly a long time investment.<br>
<br>
I was twenty-nine before I decided to enter college and get a degree to teach
music in school.&nbsp; Through the guidance of a wonderful woman who was my
vocal instructor, I had been teaching piano privately and sharing what I had
learned over the years.&nbsp; She believed in me and asked me why I was not in
college.&nbsp; The idea was totally foreign to me.&nbsp; I had a family, no
money, and she was suggesting college.&nbsp; However, she had watered the seed
and the thought of learning began to sprout in my mind.&nbsp; The next day, I
went back to the town where I had been raised, to the street upon which I had
lived, and to the building through which I had strolled so many times to look
at the scientific exhibits on my way home from school.&nbsp; I walked into the
office and I asked to enroll in college.&nbsp; There was going to be a harvest
in God's garden.<br>
<br>
It was not an easy goal to attain, but with God's help and the cooperation of
my children, I managed to take care of the family, take the necessary courses,
and graduate with my class four years later.&nbsp; The only blight to my
success was that God had called my Pop home to be with Him just before my
senior year of college.&nbsp; Pop had been my strongest champion all of the way
through, although when I started, he had told my Mother that it was an
impossible task I was undertaking. However, once he saw my determination, he
had shared in my successes by sending me a dime for each A I had achieved in my
courses, just like he had done when I was in high school.&nbsp; He was so eager
to see me graduate that on the same day he died, he had laid five dimes on his
dresser and told my Mother that those were for me for my last grade card.&nbsp;
From there, he walked up to the hayfield to help my brother and his family in
the hayfield and suffered a massive coronary.<br>
<br>
Pop was gone.&nbsp; I had never even considered a world without my Pop and his
loss was the greatest heartache of my life.&nbsp; We had just buried his
Mother, the Grandmother to whom I had been so close, two weeks to the day prior
to his death.&nbsp; The two dearest people in my world, who loved me
unconditionally and with whom I felt the closest, had suddenly been taken from
my life.&nbsp; I do not know how I would have been able to accept His will if
He had not shown me of His existence and the work He had for me to do on that
cold winter's day fifteen years earlier.<br>
<br>
I will always miss him; but I know that God must have needed him more than me
and my faith in Him was my only sustaining thought in the years to come.&nbsp;
Whenever I achieved another step,&nbsp; I felt Pop's presence with me.&nbsp;
That long awaited day a year later when I received my Honor Key, I knew he
walked across the stage with me; my first day in the classroom I sensed him by
my side; the day when I graduated with my Master's degree, I thought to myself,
&quot;Let's go, Pop; this one is for you,&quot; as I walked across the
stage.&nbsp; Many times during my years of teaching, when a student&nbsp; would
finally acquire the concept I was attempting to teach, I would sense Pop's
presence.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I became Administrator of a county wide school
for the handicapped, I walked in the first day knowing that Pop was smiling
down in fatherly approval.<br>
<br>
I wonder, if God had not taught me so many years before about Himself and the
work I was to do, would I have gone on to achieve after the loss of my
Pop?&nbsp; Or, would the sprout have withered and died and the work of the
Gardener been wasted forever?&nbsp; I also wonder if I have done enough with
the gift He gave me.&nbsp; Is there more that I am to do than what I have achieved
thus far?&nbsp; Perhaps in sharing this story here, I am continuing the lesson
He gave me so long ago. <br>
<br>
I suppose that none of us will know about our records in the Great Ledger until
we join our Maker.&nbsp; However, there is one thing of which I am certain. I
will once again hear the Angels sing and enjoy the Music of Heaven forevermore
when that Great Day comes, for I know that God is.&nbsp; I have heard the
Angels sing.<br>

Notes for MARJORY ANN PETTY:<br>
My original birth certificate had my name spelled Marjorie.&nbsp; My Mother
insisted that she had told the Nurse when I was born that the spelling was
Marjory.&nbsp; In the spring of 1990, I traveled to Ohio from Texas for the
sole purpose of going to the Perry Co., Courthouse and getting my birth
certficate altered.&nbsp; We were traveling to Europe that summer and none of
my identification matched the need certificate.<br>

The sources for the Green family have been well documented by the Quaker Church
Records as well as the diligent researchers you find listed in the Bibliography
at the end of the document.&nbsp; Many hours of research were contributed by
many GREEN descendants to produce the product you find here.&nbsp; Personally,
I could not begin to put a number to the hours I have spent computerizing the
entire document.&nbsp; In addition, through the wonderful age of electronics, I
have been able to locate numerous cousins all over the United States and in
England and Ireland.&nbsp; Many of them contributed a generation or two to a
line we already had in order to have a more up to date finished product.<br>
<br>
I made the mistake a year ago of merging two files when I discovered to my
consternation that I had been adding information to two different files.&nbsp;
Don't ask me how, I just did; and, it was several weeks before I discovered the
error.&nbsp; I decided to merge the two files and found myself with a huge file
which had to be gone over one by one in order to eliminate duplicate sources,
names, dates, notes, and most anything else you can imagine.&nbsp; Only if you
have worked w/ a computer can you fully realize the immense headache I suffered
before getting everything, I hope, back to normal.&nbsp; Throughout the
process, I found errors I would not have known about so not everything&nbsp;
about the experience was bad.&nbsp; It just seemed that way at the time.<br>
<br>
One thing I have learned is that you are never finished w/ a genealogical
file.&nbsp; You are constantly thinking of something to add to this person's history,
or a personal memoir that you want to add, or someone sends you another
generation's latest addition to the family.&nbsp; You are never finished.&nbsp;
So, this file will continue to grow and upon my demise, it will become the
property and responsibility for a couple of my grandchildren who have shown an
interest in the field.&nbsp; Hopefully, someone will keep the line going.&nbsp;
I would hate to think that all of this has been done, documented, typed,
recorded and shared only to be lost forever w/o updating.&nbsp; That would
sadden me a great deal.&nbsp; So, please take responsibility for keeping your
branch of the tree growing.&nbsp; My work on it will end someday and you are
all on your own.<br>
<br>
It was at this point, that I decided to burn a CD for the GREEN part of this
document.&nbsp; There is less to be added to that branch than there is my
paternal side, and since the Greens are not related to the PETTY line, I will
stop here and give them their record.&nbsp; Needless to say, there may well be
further additions to the GREEN family but I will try to supply them w/ updates
to be added as I find them.<br>

<br>
Notes for ROBERT WAYNE PECK:<br>
Bob was always skilled in mechanical work.&nbsp; From the time he was little,
he loved to fix things and usually could find a pretty good way of improving
anything that was broken.&nbsp; He drove truck for Steel companies and used to
make two trips to Cleveland daily w/ compressed cars for steel
reclamation.&nbsp; He was also one of the local drivers who took a semi packed
tight w/ much need hay during a drought in the southern states a few years
back.&nbsp; He was on TV but unfortunately, we didn't get a photo of his
achievement.&nbsp; The NC farmers were most happy to see the arrival of the
convoy.<br>
<br>
He was in charge of the garage for Garn Trucking where he kept their fleet of
semi trucks on the road, often rewiring, rebuilding, and certainly retuning the
engines for all of them.&nbsp; He also played softball for Astro, for whom he
had worked even before H.S. graduation.&nbsp; He possesses a unique ability to
lay a bead in welding which gave him the reputation of being the best welder
around.&nbsp; His skills were highly sought out by Wooster area companies,
including Wooster College during one of their enlargement programs, and even
his own brother told me he was the best of any around.&nbsp;&nbsp; Brothers
don't always compliment their siblings w/ statements like that.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, health problems reared their ugly head and Bob's ability to use
his many talents was brought to a halt.&nbsp; In his early 30s he started
experiencing lumbar sacrailiac problems that prevented him from working.&nbsp;
Numerous surgeries proved to be only stop gap measures for the debilitating
situation of his bones degenerating along w/ the inherited rheumatoid arthritic
problems of his Mother. It is most unfortunate that genes can hand down the bad
things just the same as they can pass along artistic skills.&nbsp; Bob has been
totally disabled for about 10 years now and has just recently gone through a
corneal ulcer of the eye which has taxed his patience and faith almost to his
limits.&nbsp; For almost 3 months now, he has had the eye sewn shut and was
being given little hope that the eye was going to heal itself. He holds the
records for being show to heal!&nbsp; However, it was my pleasure just
yesterday, to hear his Dr. exclaim that he couldn't be more pleased at the
recent improvment in his condition.&nbsp; It is starting to heal and soon the
pain should decrease.&nbsp; Let us all hope and pray that that is so.<br>

Notes for WILLIAM ALVA PECK:<br>
Bill had worked at numerous type of work since he left Mansfield School of
Technology which later became a part of Ohio State University.&nbsp; He started
welding at Astro Metallurgical prior to graduation from H.S.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
However, the work w/ which he regarded the most pride, was his work w/ Volvo
Truck Mfg. Co. at Orville, OH.&nbsp; He was chosen to drive the very first
truck manufactured there and w/ a great sense of loss he drove the final one to
come off the line.&nbsp; He worked w/ pride at Volvo building the best truck on
the road he has always maintained and he was sad to learn that they were closing
the plant in Orville,&nbsp; They had offered him a position in VA but he didn't
want to pick up and move from OH; so, w/ a great reluctance he started on a new
course.&nbsp; He has used his welding skills and is a journeyman now in the
construction of huge sewage plants which are being built all over this part of
OH.&nbsp; Sometimes, he has to drive for over an hour to get to work, but in
these time when jobs are scarce, he considers himself fortunate indeed to have
a position.&nbsp; Thus far, they have kept him busy and on the payroll.<br>
One of his greatest accomplishments, of course, is his daughter, Caitlin
Elizabeth, who is about to start her sophomore years at Clearfork H.S. near
Butler, OH.&nbsp; She is an excellent student and budding musician.&nbsp; She
plays alto sax and clarinet, w/ the clarinet being her favorit<br>

THOMAS2, JOHN1)165 was born Unknown in Ashland, Ohio.&nbsp; She married
FREDERICK A. HOSFELD April 08, 1972 in St. Mary's Catholic Church, Wooster,
Ohio166.&nbsp; He was born Abt. 1951 in Wayne Co., Ohio.<br>
<br>
Notes for MARCIA ANNE PECK:<br>
Marcia is the Librarian for the Shreve Elementary School and doing quite
well.&nbsp; She is highly thought of and well respected by her fellow staff
members.&nbsp; The Library has more than doubled in size since she took the
position and she has written and recieved over 18 grants during her time
there.&nbsp; The RIF Reading program is well supported by Marcia and all of the
staff.&nbsp; The reading scores are a direct reflection of their achievemnt in
this field.&nbsp; She has been honored and featured by various community groups
and was recently nominated as one of the Outstanding Librarians from a Seven
State District, an honor she says she doesn't have a chance of winning but
feels mighty honored just to be named. <br>
<br>
Marcia and Fred recently achieved that most pleasant feeling of having seen all
of their offspring through college.&nbsp; At one point, they had 3 in college
at the same time.&nbsp; Todd graduated from Toledo in northwestern OH a day
ahead of Corey graduating at Marietta on the Ohio River and opposite end of the
state. <br>
<br>
Marcia continues to pursue her artistic skills by painting a mural directly
above a new reading area she has developed in the library.&nbsp; Bears, of all
sizes and descriptions, have been her interest since she was little.&nbsp; She
owns a huge collection of collector bears as well as using a &quot;Bear&quot;
decor throughout her home and workplace.&nbsp; She no longer has time for her
ceramics painting, at which she was so skilled, but tells me that when she
retires, she wants to resume that activity also.&nbsp; I still have several of
her cedramic articles in my home.<br>
<br>
Fred also gets credit for some of Corey's talents.&nbsp; He is a skilled
draftsman and worked diligently for Astro Metallurgical for many years; but
w/in the last year he decided to go w/ another locally owned and managed
business and is happy in his new surroundings.&nbsp; Both parents are sticklers
for details and perfectionism so that Corey's obvious talents and skills are
well deserved.<br>

Notes for TODD ERIC HOSFELD:<br>
Todd graduated from Toldedo State University with his Bachelore's Degree in
June, 2000.[PO New FTW Family File GEDC.FTW]<br>
<br>
Todd is employed by Global Air shipping and is in a mid-management position
doing quite well w/ them.&nbsp; The family had hoped he would return to
northcentral OH but he has remained in the Toledo area on his own.&nbsp; There
is a young lady by the name of Amanda there who could be part of the reason for
his decision.<br>

<br>
Notes for COREY MICHAEL HOSFELD:<br>
Corey graduated from Marietta College, Marietta, Ohio in June, 2000 with his
Bachelor's Degree.&nbsp; He immediately went to work for the Ashland Times
Gazette in Ashland, Ohio as a layout person.&nbsp; They liked his art work so
well that they soon hired two people for him to train so that he could work
exclusively on the art design work.&nbsp; He recently received an award from
the Associated Press for some of his art work design.&nbsp; He is currectly
working for the Wooster Daily Record primarily, a sister newspaper to the
Ashland Times Gazette.[PO New FTW Family File GEDC.FTW]<br>
<br>
<br>
Following the above information, Corey has acquired further honors.&nbsp; He
was an honor student at Marietta and his excellence is continuingt to come
forth.&nbsp; He was hired by the sister newspaper, The Wooster Daily Record,
and ended up doing all of the art layout work for both papers.&nbsp; While he
was working there, he decided to submit some of his work for a publication
which is most exclusive.&nbsp; It is an Art Magazine for Artists.&nbsp; After sending
in the required submissions he promptly forgot about the contest until they
contacted him to alert him that he was in the finals.&nbsp; The magaize
periodically selects 25 young artists from all over the world to be mentioned
as &quot;up and coming&quot; new talent.&nbsp; From that group of 25, they
select three to feature.&nbsp; He was selected as one of the three featured
artists and has had the pleasure of seeing his photo and write up along w/
photos of his submissions published in the International magazine.&nbsp; We are
all most proud of him and Grandma has a copy of the magazine!<br>
July, 2003<br>
<br>
Corey and Liz Alesio, his fiance, will marry in October 2003.&nbsp; Liz is a
journalist and they met through both of them being employed at the
newspapers.&nbsp; Since then, she has decided to go free lance and has been
successful in having her articles picked up by the Mansfield News Journal,
where the grandparents can see her work quite often, and has just submitted an
article to a magazine the details of which are not known by me at this point.<br>

<br>
Notes for ANDREW JOSEPH HOSFELD:<br>
Andy has distinguished himself by first, attending and graduating w/ honors
from Grandma's Alma Mater, Ashland University.&nbsp; He majored in religion and
philosophy w/ History minor.&nbsp; He was at that point planning on a career in
Christian Education or ministry.&nbsp; After graduation, he decided not to
attend college that fall to start his Master's.&nbsp; He wanted a rest.&nbsp;
During that semester, he was aubstitute teaching at two different school
systems, which kept him busy almost daily.&nbsp; He entered his Master's Degree
program in January, 2003 and continued to teach for Shreve/Triway and
Hillsdale, from which he graduated, school systems.&nbsp; He got hooked on
Education, which I am beginning to think runs in the family!&nbsp; He has
changed his program enough to include education courses giving him
certification in that field while he continues to make plans for the
future.&nbsp; His ultimate goal is either teaching on a college level or going
into Admnistration in a school system.&nbsp; He has a special fondness for
second graders which is such a necessary field.&nbsp; We need more males in that
field so if he continues in that line, he will not want for a position.<br>
<br>
He and his fiance Joy will marry this September, 2003. <br>

Christian Church.&nbsp; He was born Abt. 1952.&nbsp; She married (2) DAVID E.
PRESTON August 24, 1982 in Wooster, Ohio; First Christian Church.&nbsp; He was
born Abt. 1953.<br>
<br>
Notes for LAURA LYNNE PECK:<br>
Laura has distinguished herself in the field of music since she was four years
old and her Mother discovered that she had perfect pitch, a gift that God does
not distribute to many out of any group of 100.&nbsp; She continues to remain
active by directing church choir and teaching piano in the community, much like
her Mother used to do!.&nbsp; She also likes to take part in the Red Stocking
Revue, every other year when the Wooster Community Women's Group organizes the
show for a money making project.<br>
<br>
She also has a most successful business on ebay by hunting and selling funky
junque items, as she calls them.&nbsp; She has always been partial to the 1940s
era and is skilled in locating, recognizing the value of the items,
photographing them and placing them on ebay for sale.&nbsp; In fact, she has
been so successful that she decided to sell her story by that name in Wooster
because she can stay home and do as wello or better than she can rent a
building and travel each day to open a business.&nbsp; Recently, she decided
that she had left a stone unturned and decided to study inm the medical
field.&nbsp; She went through extensive training for the Wooster Eye Clinic,
which is now a part of the Cleveland Clinic, and works parttime in that
capacity.&nbsp; They would like for her to work full time, but she prefers the
variety of doing all of the different things listed here.&nbsp; In her
&quot;spare&quot; time she continues to finish raising her second family of
Kyle and Jenny.&nbsp; The Gilbert boys are both gone from home and getting
along fine, so things are not quite as hectic as they used to be.&nbsp; Now,
she taxis Jenny to horseriding, tennis, soft ball, etc. as well as attending
Dave's tennis team's busy schedule which he coaches for Triway H.S.<br>

Clinton administration closed many of the military bases, and Dave was forced
out prior to his proper retirememnt time.&nbsp; He owned and maintained a Golf
Game business, electronic gold games played inside, but decided to obtain his
teaching certification and was hired by Shreve Elementary, right across the
street from where they live.&nbsp; So, we add another teacher to our family.<br>

<br>
Notes for RYAN GILBERT:<br>
Ryan started college at Mt. Union in Alliance, OH; but, his parents soon noted
that he was home almost every weekend.&nbsp; He was a homebody!&nbsp; So, after
a football neck injury, he decided to forget playing football in college, he
returned home and transferred to Kent State and/o Akron University, also an
Alma Mater of Grandma's, and instead majored in education w/ the thoughts of
coaching and teaching. <br>
He graduated as an honor student in December 2001.&nbsp; Last fall, he and
London were married in the Shreve Methodist Church.<br>
&nbsp;In the meantime, he began working for the Bank where his Mother had
worked and liked it so well that he has remained in that position.&nbsp; He and
London have recently purchased a home in Shreve, just up the street from his
folks, and London is working at Wooster Community Hospital I believe in the
accounting department.&nbsp; She will most probably finish her work to become a
CPA somewhere in the future.<br>

Notes for BENJAMIN F. GILBERT:<br>
Ben went through the training program for management for Domino Pizza while the
family was still living in Norfolk, VA.&nbsp;&nbsp; He finished that program
and worked for a while in that capacity but when Dave and Laura returned to
Shreve following Dave's retirement from the Navy, Ben and Jeannine soon
followed.&nbsp; Baby Jeanna Marie arrived.&nbsp; Since that time, the couple
has divorced amiably, and they share Jenna quite nicely, even though Ben's work
has taken him out of Shreve.&nbsp; He is living near Medina and doing quite
well w/ Port Petroleum w/ whom he has been employed as management since he came
to OH.<br>
