<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>For many years
the 394 hill folk who reside in the small community of Clarington, on the
eastern border of <st1:State w:st="on">Ohio</st1:State>, had a favorite name
for a sharp spine of land overlooking the Ohio River, which separates the <st1:PlaceName
w:st="on">Buckeye</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">State</st1:PlaceType>
from <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">West Virginia</st1:place></st1:State>.
Every spring the ridge is festooned with dogwood blossoms and, in the hot
summertime, there is the sweet smell of alfalfa and hay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The townspeople
call the site &quot;Beautiful Ridge.&quot; And so it is, beautiful is more than
name. The area houses friendly people along the blacktop road which services
the few families fortunate enough to live there. They are away from the dirt
and the smog, and on a summer nights the residents can sit on their porches
while cool breezes fan their brows, dampened with sweat from their toil as
tillers of the land that God has entrusted to their care. But, lo, on a wintry
day the Specter of Death rode across Beautiful Ridge, carrying with him his
scythe. And his harvest that day was <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Clyde
Dierkes</b>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The 65-year old
bachelor had been known and loved by people for miles around. He truly believed
the the Biblical saying: &quot; I am my brother's keeper.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>A general
handyman by trade, Clyde Dierkes was never too busy to fix a neighbor's porch
swing or re-hang a door warped by the bitter cold which in the winter, swept
across the ridges in Monroe County.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>As a boy he had
fished in the nearby river, hunting in the surrounding hills and swum in the
town's Possum Creek. He could remember the days when Clarington was a bustling
ship-building town and old-fashioned paddle-wheelers slipped down the ways to
carry merchandise from the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Ohio</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Valley</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> to far-distant
river points north and south.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>One of those
who knew Clyde Dierkes well was Monroe County Sheriff Francis L.
&quot;Tink&quot; Sulsberger. &quot;A good man,&quot; the lawman said about him
recently, as he recounted the events believed to have occurred on the fatal
night of Sunday, January 25, 1970.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>For just as
Clyde Dierkes was known the county over as a Samaritan, there were those who
thought the bachelor had played the role of Casanova when he'd come, as a
handyman, to the aid of some farmers' wives. As so often happens, &quot;the
evil that men do live after them; the good is oft interred with their
bones.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Not being a
student of Shakespeare, Clyde Dierkes had no way of knowing that some might
misinterpret his efforts to be helpful...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Sunday dawned
like many others which Clyde Dierkes had known in his more than six decades in
the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Ohio</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">Valley</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>. The area was in the grip of a
cold wave. Blocks of ice clogged the river. A frost was slowly beginning to
disappear under the morning sun as the 65-year-old handyman set out to fix a
breakfast before journeying down to Clarington, where he usually picked up his
Sunday newspaper.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>[Little did bachelor know as he peered at morning sun
from his home that it was his last glimpse of such serenity.]<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>Boozer his pet beagle- hound, whined to be let
outside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;O.K., pal
just a minute,&quot; the bachelor said to his constant companion. He opened the
back door and took a whiff of the crisp morning air. &quot;Looks like a nice
day, Boozer. I should be able to get some work accomplished in the garage
today. I might even get to my neighbors to see if they need any spare jobs done
this week.&quot; With a happy heart he watched the sun peep over the hills of <st1:State
w:st="on">West Virginia</st1:State>, lining the east side of the <st1:place
w:st="on">Ohio River</st1:place>. Little did he know that this was the last
time he would enjoy such beauty...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Following his
customary pattern, the bachelor finished his breakfast, collected his overshoes
and coat and as he prepared to go into town, whistled for his dog.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Later, neighbor
would wonder just what transpired that day. Some recalled waving to the
friendly hill man as he drove past in his utility van. Others remembered seeing
him near the post office in town.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The operator of
one of the town's service stations was to remember a small purchase Clyde
Dierkes made. &quot;He intended to check his windshield wipers, I guess,&quot;
the merchant was to say later, upon recalling that he'd sold him some wiper
blades.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The owners of a
small country store just at the bottom of the series of ridges overlooking,
Clarington, were to offer additional information. Clyde Dierkes passed right in
front of their rural outlet that Sunday morning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The man and
wife who run the shop are popular in the community. They operate a neat,
friendly place to shop. No hustle of shopping carts. It is a comfortable haven
where you may stop, chat about the day's news and leisurely make your choice of
produce or groceries.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Clyde Dierkes
generally was among those who stopped by of a morning on his way to whatever
job he had to do that day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;A
good-hearted man,&quot; was the woman's opinion of her neighbor, whom she had
known since childhood.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>All over town
that Sunday people saw Clyde Dierkes. They were to remember the incidents later
when the full, grim story unfolded on an isolated farm, stark, bleak and
abandoned to the ravages of time and weather.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Sheriff
Sulsberger, like the doomed bachelor, had a full work schedule that Sabbath. To
most people in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Monroe</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">County</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>, the official has
the reputation of being fair but strict in keeping the peace. His deputies
maintain close surveillance on the highways running through the county, south
of the main East-West Interstate 70 highway. Sheriff Sulsberger is proud of his
colleagues. In 1966, the county recorded no fatalities for an entire year.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The official
was re-elected in 1968 as chief law officer for <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Monroe</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">County</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>,
where he is affectionately called at times &quot;The Great Impersonator.&quot;
He got the title for the roles he sometimes assumes in his investigation. Once
he disguised himself as a hobo to crack a vice ring operating out of
Clarington. A few years ago, he grew a beard and frequented the places a
suspected burglar was known to haunt. Resultantly, he secured the evidence to
convict the robber.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>But on the
morning of Sunday, January 25, 1970, chasing criminals had to be put aside
temporarily; the lawman was battling the flu. Feeling miserable, he had made up
his mind to &quot;take it easy&quot; for one day, hoping that his phone
wouldn't ring too many times. Or, if it did, perhaps his deputies could handle
whatever situations arose.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>However, such
was not to be the case. Around 7 p.m., [Faithful dog, Boozer, howling at
doorstep for his master, aroused suspicions of neighbors that foul play was
afoot.] the familiar ring brought Sheriff Sulsberger to the phone. What
transpired set into action a chain of events which didn't end for the <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Monroe</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">County</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
lawman until three days later...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;This is
Ella Bonar, in Clarington,&quot; said the troubled voice at the other end of
the wire. &quot;I'm worried concerning my Uncle Clyde Dierkes. I've been
calling his house for about an hour, but I can't reach him. I contacted his
neighbors and they say all the lights are on in his place and that the dog,
Boozer, is howling on the front porch. I'm sure something must be wrong! Can
you get down there to check?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The official
tried to calm the woman. &quot;Maybe <st1:place w:st="on">Clyde</st1:place>
just went on an errand and forgot to turn out the lights,&quot; he suggested.
&quot;But I'll have somebody check for you. We'll get on it right away.&quot;
The lawman paused. &quot;Did you say Boozer is on the porch? That's odd. Your
uncle always takes that hound with him wherever he goes.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>Ella Bonar was quick to say, &quot;I know sheriff. And
from what the neighbors tell me, my uncle's van is parked in the driveway. They
can see it from their ridge. Therefore, he can't be on an errand!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Sheriff
Sulsberger ran his fingers through his neatly trimmed hair as he assessed what
he had heard. Seconds later, he dialed the number of the phone at the home of one
of his deputies, Junior Miller, and relayed to him the conversation he'd had
with Ella Bonar. &quot;Get down to Clarington and see what's going on. Call me
if you need me. But take it easy. Looks as if the snow isn't going to stop
tonight and the roads may be bad,&quot; he concluded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Receiving
assurance from Deputy Miller that instructions would be carried out, the
sheriff, still ailing, started to relax in one of the chairs in his
well-appointed living room when the jangling of the telephone again brought him
to his feet. &quot;I'll get it, honey,&quot; he called to his wife, who was
winding up the kitchen chores after Sunday supper.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The voice that
came over the wire was low. It was obvious that the speaker was trying to
conceal his identity. &quot;I think you'd better get down to Clarington, Clyde
Dierkes is in trouble!&quot; was the message. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Immediately
after, Sheriff Sulsberger tried to stall the caller. &quot;This connecton's
bad. I can't hear what you said,&quot; he replied to the mystery voice, as he
tried to figure how to keep the line open and, at the same time, alert his wife
to contact headquarter via radio so that he dispatcher could trace the call.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;I said
Clyde Dierkes is in trouble,&quot; the annonymous speaker repeated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;Who is
this?&quot; the sheriff pressed. &quot;Hello/ Hello.&quot; But the line went
dead.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Rushing to his
two-way radio, the sheriff alerted his other three deputies to stand by for his
arrival. Then he called out to his wife, &quot;I'm heading to Clarington, might
not be back right away.&quot; He pulled on his heavy driving boots, wrapped a
scarf around his neck and raised the zipper on his heavy jacket. A hurried
good-by kiss at the door- and the ailing lawman, forgetting his own discomfort,
was on his way to the home of Clyde Dierkes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Certain bits of
information he had heard over the years; rumors concerning love affairs; veiled
accusations against the bachelor came to Sheriff Sulsberger's mind as he
negotiated the twisting turns in the road which leads from Woodsfield, the
county seat, to Clarington, along the Ohio River. It was difficult to believe

going to the Dierkes' place in Clarington. Join us there. Get in touch with
Junior Jones and relay my message. Junior Miller is already headed that way,
the sheriff instructed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Receiving an
affirmative reply from Deputy Headley, the sheriff pressed harder on the
accelerator of his cruiser, not knowing to what he was rushing. A simple case
of a man's leaving some lights on in his home while he made a trip for some
supplies- or worse. Such are complex, sometimes sinister problems faced by our
lawmen in the line of duty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>At this point,
the sheriff's radio came to life. &quot;Unit 5 calling Unit 1, I'm here in
Clarington,&quot; Duputy Miller reported. &quot;I talked with Ella Bonar who
reported her uncle missing. Then I came up here on the ridge. She's right; the
lights are on in the house and the dog is howling at the front door. I'm being
careful to avoid trampling on any footprints. But there's a crowd beginning to
gather. I'll keep them back until you get here at the scene.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The sheriff, at
that moment, drove through the community of Cameron, just outside the city
limits of Clarington. &quot;I'll be there in just a minute or two. How's the
road up there on the ridge?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;Not bad.
Slick near that one sharp curve near the top so watch it,&quot; came the reply.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>It didn't take
long for word to spread among the fewer than 500 people in the river community.
A phone call here or there- and the wires began to buzz as neighbors and
friends found out that something was amiss at Clyde Dierkes' residence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>By the time
Sheriff Sulsberger had pulled up outside the bachelor's dwelling, he could see
the gathering crowd standing around the flashing red lights of Duputy Miller's
car.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The official
hurried forward and joined the tall deputy near the farm home's front gate.
&quot;I<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>don't want anyone going on the
property until we've had a chance to see what's wrong, if anything,&quot; he
announced.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Turning to one
of the bachelor's neighbors, Jim Farrell, the sheriff inquired, &quot;Have you
seen <st1:place w:st="on">Clyde</st1:place> today?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The farmer,
nodded. &quot;Sure. It was around suppertime. I saw <st1:place w:st="on">Clyde</st1:place>
drive up in his van. I got to watching TV and it wasn't until about an hour ago
that I heard the dog howling'. That's when I noticed all the lights on in <st1:place
w:st="on">Clyde</st1:place>'s house.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>As the sheriff
continued to quiz the other neighbors, Deputies Headley and Keylor brought
their cruisers to a halt on the shoulder of the blacktop road; they were soon
followed by Deputy Jones. Thereupon, Sheriff Sulsberger and his colleagues
proceeded to advance slowly into the farmyard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;If there
are any footprints, they're covered by the snow,&quot; the official pointed
out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The weather in
January in the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Ohio</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Valley</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> had been among the
worst in history. Several burglaries had been carried out without the culprits'
leaving a trace of footprints, simply because the snowfall seemed to favor the
criminals and not the law by covering any traces the thieves had left behind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>When the lawmen
reached the porch, the bachelor's beagle, Boozer, wagged his tail furiously.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;Sure,
boy. That's a good dog,&quot; the law officer said, rubbing the hound's ears.
&quot;We'll find your master,&quot; he added, not sure whether or not he really
would. Or, if he did what his find might turn up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;Might as
well let those onlookers come on the property,&quot; the sheriff told Deputy
Keylor. &quot;There are no footprints to worry about, so they won't be covering
any evidence. But don't let them into the house as yet.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>With that,
Sheriff Sulsberger tested the front door, found it open and led his colleagues
in a search of the one-story frame house. There was no sign of the bachelor,
nor was there any indication of foul play in the house. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>Turning to Deputies Jones and Miller, the official instructed,
&quot;Go outside and check <st1:place w:st="on">Clyde</st1:place>'s van and
pick-up truck. Scour the garage and see what you can find in the way of
telltale clues.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Meanwhile, the
sheriff began interviewing the neighbors as to what they had seen that day.
This line of endeavor led to a blank wall. No one had seen Clyde Dierkes after
he apparently had returned home early Sunday night for supper.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;Tell you
what!&quot; the official announced to the puzzled onlookers. I'll get some
lights from the cruiser and we'll all fan out and search the farm. Watch out
for anything out of the ordinary; call me quickly if you spot something.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Thus a search
party was formed, consisting of the deputies and the missing bachelors's
friends and neighbors. But to no avail.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Next, Deputy
Phillips approached Sheriff Susberger and his fellow officers as they gathered
a few feet away from the milling neighbor. &quot;What about those stories which
have been floating around for the past few months about Clyde Dierkes' making a
play for some of the ladies in town?&quot; he asked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The official
shrugged, “ I think people are always ready to believe the worst about others.
From what I understand, <st1:place w:st="on">Clyde</st1:place> was only trying
to help his friends. He is kind to everyone and especially courteous to
womenfolk.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Over the years,
the sheriff had heard all sorts of rumors connecting Clyde Dierkes with this
woman or that one-particularly those to whom he had been of service as a
handyman. But like any good officer, he never based his cases on hearsay. When
he had his facts and they were supported by hard evidence, he would take
action. But, not until then.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>However, the
official did not dismiss the gossip completely. He realized that jealousy can
be spawned by a simple circumstance which will throw together a man and someone
else's wife- a chat at the supermarket, serving together on a PTA committee-
any of them innocent happenings- or a handyman's call on a friends while the
husband was absent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>Well, I'll check out the rumors,&quot; he told his
colleagues, cutting off the conversation least something he said damaging to an
innocent person.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Leaving Deputy
Jones to guard the home of the vanished bachelor, Sheriff Susberger, after
turning off most of the lights, asked Deputy Phillips to look after the rabbit
hound Boozer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>In view of
later developments, the sheriff is reluctant to discuss the events which
followed the discovery that Clyde Dierkes was missing. Like most efficient
officers, began the slow task of developing leads which he hoped might solve
the mystery. His conversations and whatever evidence he found, if any, is
privileged information. However, it is known that the official worked on the
theory that someone might have given the wrong interpretation to Clyde Dierkes'
efforts to be helpful. Later, this proved to be true.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>But to protect
the innocent persons concerned, Sheriff Susberger, the next day, Monday,
January 26, 1970 gave out little news to the press. To a reporter in the nearby
city of <st1:City w:st="on">Wheeling</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">West Virginia</st1:place></st1:State>, he said, &quot;I'll admit we
haven't ruled out foul play in this case.&quot; Beyond that he would not
comment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>That same day,
Sheriff Sulsberger made a telephone call to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
 w:st="on">South Gate</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Michigan</st1:State></st1:place>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>Afterward, he had his cruiser gassed and oiled, which
was a tip-off that he intended to make a long journey. But except to his
deputies, the purpose of the trip was not known at that time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>To a constant
stream of calls from reporters in the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Ohio</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Valley</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>,
the official had only one comment: &quot;Clyde Dierkes is missing. We're
working on it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>With that, he got into his car and headed north on
Route 8 toward <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Barnesville</st1:City>,
 <st1:State w:st="on">Ohio</st1:State></st1:place>, and beyond.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Later events
proved that Sheriff Slusberger was not going on a &quot;mystery trip&quot; that
day. But at the moment it was that. He was working on a hunch- those flashes
that come to good officers who recall a remote fact out of the past which can
be tied to the present.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Before leaving
Beautiful Ridge, the official conferred with Monroe County Prosecutor George
Burkhart at the courthouse. Sheriff Sulsberger filled the prosecutor in at that
time on his theory concerning the mystery. &quot;I'll let you know what I find
in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">South Gate</st1:place></st1:City>,&quot;
the sheriff told the legal official.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span

was later to be divulged when the investigation came to an abrupt and grisly
denouement...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>To those not
familiar with the workings of lawmen, it must be pointed out that hundreds of
man hours go into the probe of missing persons. And, sometimes it turns out
that the individual who suppsosedly has disappeared merely decided to visit a
relative or go on<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>a fling in a distant
city!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>But Sheriff
Sulsberger knew that this was not the situation in the present instance. Clyde
Dierkes was a homebody. He was proud of his ridge-top home; he hardly ever left
Clarington, unless it was to have a saw sharpened in nearby Bellaire or to pick
up tires for his pick-up truck from a merchant across the river in <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Wheeling</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">West

he was ready to unfold what he believed had happened t the missing bachelor.
The worst was apparently true: Clyde Dierkes was dead!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Two men had

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>On Tuesday,
January 27, 1970, Sheriff Sulsberger told reporters, &quot; I think I have a

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Twenty-four
hours later, the grim find was revealed. On Wednesday morning, January 28,
1970, a group of men-including one of the pair who had been taken into custody;
he was identified as 25-year-old Floyd Stewart, of South Gate, Michigan-were
lead by Sheriff Sulsberger, slowly along six tortuous miles to the top of
Beautiful Ridge. It was a desolate spot, wind-whipped, snow-ridden.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>It was here,
from the farm home of Clyde Dierkes, that Floyd Stewart, according to the
allegations of newsmen accompanying the group, headed along a path to an
abandoned farm owned by his uncle, Harold Stewart, 41, a factory worker living
in Clarington. Harold Stewart was the second man who'd been taken into custody
under suspicion of murder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The news
reporters were kept back, so it can only be surmised that Floyd Stewart,
allegedly directed the sheriff to an unused well covered by a wooden frame
sagging with age. One the ground was Clyde Dierkes' wallet and a scraper for
removing snow from the windshield of a car.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>A faint shout
or two was heard from deep in the bowels of the earth. Then the dripping
sheriff was pulled from the well. He held a brief conversation with his
colleagues while Floyd Stewart, who stands about six feet two inches tall and
weighs more than 200 pounds, watched the activity. He wore a heavy knitted
sweater against the bitter cold.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Once again
Sheriff Sulsberger was lowered into the well. When he emerged, he wasted no

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span

inflicted by a blunt instrument.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
