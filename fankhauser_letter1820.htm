the United States of North America to come after his parents and relatives,
brought with him letters to several persons in Bern and vicinity, from their
emigrated friends and acquaintances. The letters were written by Nicolaus Fankhauser,
a carpenter of Trub, who with Mr. Steiger, left in the year 1819 and settled
afterwards in the commonwealth of Ohio. The most important parts of these
letters we will give to our readers. In May of that year, this company of our
emigrants embarked with many people of Wirtemberg, the latter being noted for
their poverty and lack of tidiness; also Prussians, Dutch and French 200
persons in number.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

from Antwerp and the journey across the water was a happy one. When a few days
after their departure, Mr. Fankhauser's brother's wife gave birth to a baby
boy, the captain and steersmen gave her many presents of provisions and she got
as good care as if she had been on land. When the ship came to about the 46th
parallel, it encountered much rain and snow. The waves went pretty high,
however not as high as some travelers in Switzerland had reported, like the
&quot;Gurten&quot; or &quot;Niesen,&quot; yet they must have been twenty-five
or thirty-five feet. One washed across the deck and Mr. Fankhauser was thrown
to the floor. He acknowledged that he would not be a sailor for all the wealth
in the world, although he would rather cross the ocean twice than sail down the
Rhine once. After the travelers had been overtaken by several days of fog, one
of them, Mr.Christian Martin of Limpach, on the morning of the 20th of July,
climbed up onto the middle mast and he saw land. It seemed like a small hill
that rose out of the sea. All present hurried now on deck in order to see the
new world. One hill after another rose out of the waves and at last they could
see trees and the lighthouse of New York. After a journey of sixty-six days,
they anchored there in the harbor. When the doctors came on board the next day
and examined the ship's company, they were much surprised to find that the
register had increased by two persons; also that no one was sick and many of
them were lively and strong. Fankhauser and his company went to Ambai, twenty
miles (six hours) from New York, where a rich German planter received them and
furnished them with the necessities for the continuation of their journey.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

bought four oxen and two wagons, upon one of which they loaded the baggage and
upon the other, the women and children. (They were altogether seven families and
had thirty-two children.) On the 6th of August they began their 600-mile
journey to the interior. They came through the states of Jersey, Pennsylvania,
Virginia and Ohio. In Jestown where there is a long bridge over the Delaware
River, they found two families of linen weavers (Perhaps one of these families
were the Minemyer family?) from Aargau who had hired out for two years and had
still two months to serve. In the Pennsylvania city of Reading, Mr. Fankhauser
met Jacob Antene at work on the street. There were in this city also several
other Swiss families who are making a good living. In Bethlehem, our travelers
were received in an extremely friendly and humane way. The good people provided
them with straw hats in order that they might better withstand the heat, loaded
their wagons with potatoes, bacon and ham, and presented the children with nick
nacks so that they did not want to eat any more bread. When Fankhauser came
into a village or city with the wagon full of children, he was stopped by the
people that he could hardly get away and always he had to be on the lookout
whether all the little ones were there. It is told that there are here many
pople who have no children and when they adopt or buy one, it is the law that
boys must work for them until twenty years of age. They are, however, sent to
school and instructed in religion. At the completion of their time service, the
boys receive $100, one horse, one plow, two cows and four sheep. The girls who
have to serve until the 18th year, receive the same amount of money, some
stock, one bed, kitchen utensils, etc.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

&quot;seen no beggar in this land, except when I looked into the mirror.&quot;
On the 19th of August we came to Lebanon. Here I found a wealthy merchant
formerly of Frutigen, by the name of Jacob Rumpf. We camped a mile from the
city beside a creek. The people brought us clothes and provisions as if they
had expected us. From here we went to Somerset, a nice city with three
churches, a Bible Society and two print shops. Here I found Mr. Krayenbuhl of
Trub, who is a brewer and gave me commission, when I would write, to greet the
clerk of Langnau and the honorable congregation of Trub, in his name. A few
miles from here there live certain Fankhausers who came from Trub, but who are
a good deal richer now than their entire village at home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Twenty miles down stream we found a river as large as the Emme, flowing into
the Ohio, and a well-improved valley, where we planned to spend the winter. We
settled on Congress Land (land which belongs to the Federal Government.) It was
now the end of October and I built myself a small shack that we might have a
roof over us, but planned to build a larger one. We were now three families on
this land and the other four went into the valley, where they soon found work.
Myself, Jacob Tuscher and Bendicht Schneider also found work, but it did not
last long. We received per day, 100 pounds of flour and 10 pounds of bacon.
Christian Ruegsegger who had traveled by way of France, also arrived at this
time. With the beginning of winter, a neighboring landowner, Mr. Spraut,
offered to give me twenty acres upon which I could live for three years, if I
would keep up the fences. Here I found three old shacks and a small barn,
almost tumbled down, which I built up again. There were two acres of volunteer
wheat which yielded twenty bushels. I planted potatoes, wheat and hemp and kept
enough in pasture so I could feed my cows.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

gone to town in order to buy a spinning wheel, I had the misfortune to lose my
house with all belongings, through a fire. But my good neighbors fitted me out
liberally. I received whole dressed hogs, flour, clothing and bedding, and
inside of two days they had built me two small houses. Soon I moved into my new
home and worked as before. Put in four acres of wheat, six of corn and a little
hemp. But we had a dry summer. All the mills stood still. From the 6th of June
till the 15th of August there was not a drop of rain. Things matured early, but
there was not much yield. But we experienced no scarcity, for here everybody
has enough in store for reserve. The year 1822 was so blest that we had not
room to store the yield. I had 200 bushels of grain. In stock I now owned two
horses, five cows and the number of sheep I do not know, for they run in the
woods. I and my son Nicolaus earned this summer in three weeks, two cows by
building chimneys. The cows are as large as those in Switzerland and give just
as much and as good milk. My brother Daniel and I have taken a contract to open
a tunnel through a hill in order to run a mill. The job is 80 feet long and we
are promised $180.00. We hope to finish it in two months. This labor is to be
paid in silver, most other work is paid for in cattle or provisions on account
of the scarcity of cash. Nearly all trade is done in exchange. Trading boats
come up the rivers. Their arrival is announced through messengers and they
exchange various merchandise for grain, meat, cheese, butter, feathers, wool,
sugar and cloth. Among these boats are many steam boats which are run by fire.
I live a mile from the Ohio and see such boats pass most every day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman";text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>The
large grain dealers buy many thousands of bushels and go with it to New
Orleans. They pay everything in silver. Land here is so rich that it needs no
fertilizer. Trees grow very rapidly. Peach trees bear in the third year; apple
trees the fourth or fifth. The country is richly provided with fruit and there
is much cider made. Americans are lazy. Hunting and fishing is their most
beloved occupation, and hunting wild bees to rob them of their honey. The woods
literally crawl with bees and I can detect no difference between wild and tame
honey. I have a great many sugar maple trees, but have not yet made a pound of
sugar from them. We live on milk, cereals and garden vegetables, and are
thereby extremely healthy and well. I have now nine children around me and
rejoice over them with all my heart. For here, you don't have to hear, &quot;I
cannot rent you my dwelling, you have too many children.&quot; Nay rather,
here, the more children, the richer the man is considered. Land is here very
cheap. An acre (45,000 ft.) for $1.25 for Congress or Government land. But they
will not sell less than a quarter or 80 acres. Rental is also cheap at two
dollars per acre. Or for the ninth bundle, or for the third, in which case,
however, the renter receives all stock, tools, etc., furnished. Whoever does
not want to rent, can settle on Congress land and rent out half of his quarter.
He needs but to go to the officials, buy a patent which cost four dollars, and
gets the land for a term of eight or ten years, and then he is assured of his
property. The Government has arranged it so that the poorest man can obtain
some property and so the land is being settled. In the United States there is
the same weight, measure and money. A bushel is two measure, the pound is a
little smaller than the Swiss pound, but the foot is half an inch longer. A
dollar contains 100 cents (Centimes or sous) 36 1\2 batzen Bern money. The
means of living are very cheap. Laborers are paid half in cash and half in
provisions. But artisans wages are high. A carpenter receives $1.50; so also a
mason. A well digger receives $2.25 a day, and board is always included in
these wages. A shoemaker asks half a dollar for a pair of shoes and a tailor
charges from two to five dollars for a dress. Girl spinners, knitters, and
seamstresses are also well paid and can earn daily about half a dollar. Work on
the farm is not as hard as in Switzerland. Grain is tramped out with horses on
a threshing floor, then winnowed. No hoe is carried into the field. No rake is
used in haying, and what one does not get with the fork is left to rot. Hay and
grain is stacked in the field. Sunday is observed very quietly, although there
are as yet no churches. The ministers travel over the country and preach here
and there in which they are supported by their congregations. Once in six weeks
one comes around who baptizes the children, and these are then brought up in
the Reformed Church. I think often of the times when the church bells called me
from all the steeples to divine service and gave them so little heed. But now I
see how Americans come twenty and thirty miles in order to hear the work of
God.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
