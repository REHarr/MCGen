<p align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>OF
MONROE COUNTY, OHIO<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p align=center style='text-align:center'><b>(<span style='color:green'>You can

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>During the 1800s, German-speaking settlers
were the largest group of immigrants in Ohio. Monroe County was no exception to
this statistic. <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>                         </span>Researcher Ernest
Thode identified three main categories of Monroe County Germanic immigration:
1) The rural Swiss who settled the northeastern townships, 2) The Palatinates
who settled in the Miltonsburg area and 3) the Germans who settled in
Woodsfield in the late 1840s. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>It began in April 1819 when a group of Swiss
immigrants left their home for a new life in America. They landed in New Jersey
and traveled overland until they came to Wheeling, West Virginia. From this
point, they descended the Ohio River by flatboat until they came to Captina in
Belmont County. There German-speaking settlers Henry <b>Schweppe</b> and George
<b>Goetz</b> welcomed them. They were told of the government land in the neighboring
northeastern part of Monroe County and encouraged to stay. In September they
arrived at Bare     s Landing (now Hannibal, Ohio Township) and were greeted by
Jacob <b>Bare</b>. He spoke the German language and he also encouraged the new
arrivals to purchase land in the steep hills that shadow the Ohio River. The
new group of settlers included the families of <b>Tisher</b>, <b>Fankhauser</b>,
<b>Marti</b>, <b>Nisperly</b> and <b>Tschappatt</b>. and others. The families
purchased lands in what is now Switzerland and Ohio Townships. Christian <b>Ruesegger</b>
followed shortly after. Although they were not the first residents of Monroe
County to speak the German tongue, they are recognized as the first group
migration to the county.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Lured by the good report sent back by
arrivals in the first group, other Swiss settlers began to arrive in the
county. Others who were seeking land joined them. They found a land similar to
their home with hills, forests and access to a large waterway, the Ohio River.
They also found large amounts of unclaimed land, which they purchased.. Soon
after arrived Peter <b>Kampfer</b>, John <b>Winder, Burgenthal, Keller, Walter,
Kanzig, Zimmerly, Kocher, Abersold, Imhoff, Hubacher, Luthey, Forney, Lapp,
Blattler, Fridiger, Winsreid</b> In 1833, brothers, Andrew, John and Jacob
Muhlemann purchased land at Buckhill Bottom in Ohio Township. The families of <b>Bauer,
Bruny, Lemley, Bigler, Krebs, Ruff, Schafer, Schindler, </b>and<b> Yenny </b>arrived
before 1840. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Beginning in the 1840s, there was heavy
migration into the two townships and many settlers spilled over into adjoining
townships. The peak of the arrivals came in 1846-1847, but immigrants continued
to arrive throughout the next decade at a rapid rate. Among this group were the
families of <b>Jennewein, Kieffer, Schnegg, Steiner, Zingg, Bachmann,
Eisenbarth, Gasser, Gotherd, Kasserman, Kreps, Lehmann, Lude, Luikart, Moser,
Niemann, Riethmiller, Riggenbach, Rufener, Schupbach, Stalder, Winkler, Yaussy,
Grossenbacher, Roth, Schnell, Tubach and Witschey. </b>Other settlers arrived
such as <b>Breck, Swetgart, Frank, Friedli, Grodhans, Kroft, Pfender, Schwing,
Gagel, Hillger, Minder, Ragel, Tegtmire, Yintz, Kaiser, Gever, Wilhelm, Fagert,
Rosenlieb, Anchutz, Arn, Ebert, Ensinger, Feisley, Kurtzmann, Mehl, Yost, and
Zink. <o:p></o:p></b></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Another major group of German-speaking
settlers settled in the Miltonsburg      Lewisville area during the 1830s. Most of
these arrivals came from neighboring towns in Germany. Some of those families
included<b> Becker, Bintz, Brubach, Buckio, Christman, Feiock, Feldner,
Fliehmann, Jacky, Kiltzer, Kindelberger, Matz, Neuhard, Pfalzgraf, Schaub,
Schenk, Schneider, and Weber.</b> Catholic families such <b>as Benninghaus,
Beidenharn, Burkhart, December, Haren, Howiler, Nauer, Oblinger, Paulus,
Riesbeck, Singer, Weisend, Yunkas, and Zwick</b> later joined them<b>. </b>Other
Protestant families arrived like <b>Claus, Freitag, Landefeld, Niebch, Hillig,
Kahrig, Just, Steinhoff, Schebele, Wittenbrook, Rapp, Schafer, Egger, Muller,
Segesser, Kuhn, Nippert, Pfalzgraf, and Stephan.<o:p></o:p></b></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>The effect of these settlers on the culture
and heritage of Monroe County has been monumental. A large portion of the
economy was the dairy farms founded by these families. The rugged, hilly
terrain (especially in the northeastern portion of the county) wasn     t blessed
with fertile soil, so the German-Swiss families turned this land into
productive and profitable dairy farms. The plentiful milk production resulted
in a strong cheese making business. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Many of the dairies were cooperative efforts
as several farms would take their milk to a dairy where a professional cheesemaker
would make the cheese. A small community in Lee Township is still known as
Dairy, so named for the dairy that operated for many years in the community.
Larger dairies such as the Hannibal Creamery, Woodsfield Ice and Creamery,
Clarington Creamery Company and the United Dairy Company were built in the
early 1900s. The cheese was often taken to markets by boat to Wheeling, West
Virginia, or Marietta, Ohio. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>The farmhouses and barns built by the Swiss
and German settlers and their children still cling to the hillsides. The
half-bank barns with an overhang and insulated with a lath and clay filler in
the walls are typical of Swiss architecture.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>For almost a century, the German language was
spoken as frequently in some communities in Monroe County as English was. It
was the language spoken in their homes, churches and schools. Children and
grandchildren of the early immigrants who had never lived anywhere but Monroe
County spoke the German language fluently. Even in recent years the traces of
the German tongue clung to words of many of the descendants. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>But the advent of World War I brought
changes. When America entered World War I, the German language was now suspect.
Government workers were sent to German-speaking churches to monitor the
services and ascertain that nothing was being said against the American
government. Gradually, the German language was dropped in church services,
records and schools. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Although its obvious effects have faded, the
heritage of the Swiss     German settlers is still unmistakable. The county     s
nickname, &quot;The Switzerland of Ohio,&quot; the scenery, which is
reminiscent of their homeland, and the many descendants that remain in the
county, remind us the spirit of these pioneers remain in the hills of Monroe
County. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
