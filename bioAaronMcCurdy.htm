yes">                             </span>Aaron McCurdy, the youngest son of John and Mary (McGill),
was born in Monongahela County, WVA on May 3, 1820. He attended the district
school in its session and received a very fair education. In 1840, he went to
Monroe County, Ohio, where he worked on a farm for his brother-in-law, Isaac
Eddy, and remained there until he married. In 1842, he married Rebecca Kinkade,
the daughter of David Kinkade of Monroe County. To this union, twelve children
were born.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

and there located. In 1852, he bought fifty acres of land near the present town
of Burning Springs, and having cleared a few acres, moved thereon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>state lawless bands of un-uniformed
soldiers with pronounced sympathy for the Confederacy; they were called
Bushrangers. In the latter part of 1861, a band of these Bushrangers attacked
Mr. McCurdy's home. He being absent at the time, his wife and children were
turned outdoors and the Bushrangers looted the place. They left a warning for
Mr. McCurdy to leave the country upon pain of death.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

another band attacked the house; again he was absent, but they did not molest
his family. Searching the house, they quietly left, leaving the same warning.
Some days later, taking his family in a canoe down the Little Kanawha River, he
took them to safety in Parkersburg, where he left them and returned to his home
only to find it in ashes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

any resources whatsoever except a cow and a spinning wheel, the latter not
being in the house when burned, he took his family to Washington County, Ohio
where he located. After the war, he sold his land in Wirt County to John
Rainbone for $100 and a few years after, this tract became very valuable, as
oil was discovered there and Burning Springs sprang into existence. Soon after
the oil was discovered; a large tank was placed on the ground and into this oil
was turned. The oil in this tank ignited and exploded. The oil leaped to the
river, carrying sheets of flames for many miles down the river. From that time,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

years of his death, Dec. 25, 1889.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

peace and quietness; he was a very industrious man, a trustworthy neighbor, a
kind husband and father. He was very attentive to his family and his home
affairs, was temperate in his habits, never indulging in strong drinks,
strictly attended to his own business and was respected by all who knew him. He
was unpretentious; what he promised he performed. His financial means were
small but it was enough to care for his family.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>LOST IN THE WILDERNESS--An
incident in the life of Aaron McCurdy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>                                     </span>When Mr. McCurdy lived in Wirt County, deer were quite
numerous in that and adjoining counties, and one day while hunting, he struck a
trail, followed it for several miles through the wilderness, when there
appeared indications of a heavy snow storm. Just then he saw a large buck which
sighted him and took flight but he pursued him. Before he realized the fact,
the snow was falling fast, so he abandoned the search, and tried to retrace his
steps but the blinding snow filled his tracks and he became lost in the
wilderness and sought shelter under an overhanging rock, and there he remained
until late that afternoon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>                                     </span>There being no lull in the storm, he again tried to find
his way out of the wilderness. He finally entered a ravine, which he followed a
short distance and came to a large rock under which appeared a cavern-like entrance.
Realizing he could not proceed much further that day, he entered and found it
led but a few feet. The ground being dry and covered with leaves, he gathered
some brush and such dry wood as he could find, started a fire near the opening,
and after consigning himself to God, sought rest in sleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>                                     </span>Next morning, when he awoke, the storm had ceased, but the
sky was cloudy and he was at a loss to know which course to pursue, but went down
the ravine and finally came to a small creek which he followed, thinking it
might lead to some settlement. He traveled along this creek until toward
evening, then left it and ascended a high elevation of land expecting to
discover some settlement. Reaching the top he could see for miles over the
wilderness, but no signs of any habitation could he discover.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>                                     </span>Descending the opposite side of the hill, he came to
another creek and traveled toward its source. Once, while crossing the creek,
his foot slipped and he fell into the water. At the same instant, the stopper
fell from his powder horn, which soon filled with water, destroying its contents.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>Recovering his gun, which also filled with
water, which dampened the powder therein and made it useless. He crossed to the
opposite bank and continued up the creek. As night approached, he heard
gunshots, but he couldn't locate from whence the sounds came. Changing his
course, he was surprised to find he had returned to the rock he had left that
morning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>                                     </span>There again he spent the night, but not as comfortable, his
powder being wet, tired with the days travel and hungry he laid again on his
bed of leaves and soon fell asleep. He did not awake until the sun was well up
in the heavens; when he attempted to rise, he discovered his feet were frozen
and perfectly numb. Working with them for some time, pounding, rubbing and
twisting them to restore circulation, he was at last able to stand. Again leaving
his dreary cave, as he termed it, he started once more to find his way home.
Traveling due west he came to a small stream into which he entered. The water
soothed his feet but he could not proceed far at a time. The day was clear and
late in the afternoon, he ascended a high knoll to locate himself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>                                     </span>Standing against a tree, he saw horsemen riding in his
direction; calling with all his might he was heard and the man rode up to him
and fired his gun. Soon other gunshots were heard and the truth soon flashed upon
Mr. McCurdy that these were the signals of his discovery. When the man, whose
name was Lemen, dismounted, Mr. McCurdy took a step toward him and fell. His
feet had frozen again. The man raised him, and place him in the saddle on the
horse. He then stated that about forty men were in search of him. He said that
the day before no trail or clue of his whereabouts could be discovered although
they had searched from daylight until dark. He also said when the search began
that morning no guns were to be fired upon any occasion unless he was found,
then when the first shot was fired, those within hearing were to fire and let
those at a distance know he had been found. When he was found, he was about ten
miles from home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>                                     </span>A few hours later, he arrived at his home and found his
wife nearly frantic with grief. For three weeks, his feet were in horrible
condition and were wrapped continuously in cotton but he could not stand on his
feet for two months.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

denomination when but 18 years of age. A few years later he became a local
preacher and preached for many years. Before his death, he prayed that the end
would come to him while asleep, and upon retiring each night would bid his
family goodbye expecting to awake in heaven. On Christmas morning, he was found
dead in bed. His wish was gratified; death had come peacefully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
