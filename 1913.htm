last few months when she grew too feeble to attend the services of the church.
A mother in Israel has fallen and gone to her reward. She is sleeping calmly
sleeping, in a new made grave, in yonders cemetery, not far form her old home.
But the Christ has tunneled the grave and illuminated the dark valley of the
shadow of death, making the gloomy picture of centuries past, serve only as a
background to bring out in bold relief the golden tints of a future life. There
is a life beyond this vale of tears. The words of inspiration also proclaim now
is Christ risen from the dead and became the first fruits of them that slept.
Death is swallowed up in victory. O death where is thy sting? O grave where it
thy victory? The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law. But
thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
Then let us dry our tears and submit to the ear Fathers will who doeth all
tings well. And while we shall mourn the loss and miss the presence of mother
let us ever honor and cherish the memory of her life and noble christian
character. Eight sons and four daughters are left to mourn the loss of a
mother. Her funeral was held from the home Monday afternoon, Rev. Simmons

Thursday October 9<sup>th</sup> at the age of 79 years and 29 days, was born in
Germany, September 20<sup>th</sup>, 1834, in which country he passed the first
16 years of his life. Like many another sturdy young lad of that time he
thought the advantages of America to be superior to those of his native country
and immigrated to thee shores coming almost directly to this county where he
spent the balance of his life, the first years in the vicinity of Malaga and
Miltonsburg and the balance on his home farm near the town of Lebanon. At the
age of 21 he was united in marriage to Miss Ph...Kinnach, of this union were
born 12 children, three of which died in infancy, the remaining nine being well
known residents of this and Washington counties. About this time also Mr. Bode
joined the German Evangelical Lutheran church of Harrietsville of which he
remained a faithful member until the time of his death.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

in a small way and for the following 44 years continued in this business
becoming in time to be one of the best known and largest buyers in this
section. At the age of 69 he practically retired from all business and spent
the balance of his days in the peace and quiet which belonged to the close of
such an active career.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

little cemetery at Lebanon, Ohio, placed there by the tender hands of six of
his stalwart grandsons lies the moral remains of H. F. Bode. Written deep in

Maggie Weisend, Joseph Brister, Mrs. George Kindleberger, Mrs. George Knopp,
living near the home of the deceased, and Mrs. H. H. Dearth of Summerfield.
Sixteen grandchildren and seven great grandchildren. After a short but painful
illness this beloved mother fell asleep; although the best of care and
ministrations of loyal hands and loving hearts were bestowed, and everything
known to medical science was done to prolong this mother's life was without
success. Aunt Kate, as she was called by all who knew her, was of a quiet and
unexcitable nature; a kind a and loving disposition and she lavished all the
wealth of her affection upon her family and large circle of acquaintances, and
she reached out with a hand always overflowing with charity and no one was ever
known to leave her door hungry. Her life is an open book from which we can
derive many good and noble examples worthy of our imitation. Love of her
family, self sacrificing to all and her home was her happiness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

eternal home, there to dwell in the presence of our heavenly Father, if
faithful until death. Heaven, that land of quiet rest, toward which, those worn
out and tired with the toils of earth, and their head are ripened for the grave

1834; was married three times. Was the father of 9 children, 7 sons and 2
daughters. Three sons preceded him to the great beyond several years ago. A
wife, four sons, two daughters, 18 grand children and one great granddaughter
survive to mourn his departure. He was a member of the Methodist church
fifty-one years. He bore his afflictions without murmur or complaint and asked
his Father in Heaven to be merciful that his suffering hours might be short.
His prayers were answered. Only one week from the day he took sick until his
Master knocked at the door of his heart and he was ready to obey his call.
Departed this life July 24, 1913, leaving him at the age of 78 years, 7 months
and 15 days. Six years ago he was stricken with two strokes of paralysis but
had been able to go wherever he desired until within one week of his death. The
angel of death has left a lonely vacant place in our home which never can be
filled, but a lonesomer place in the hearts of his loved ones left behind. His
youngest daughter has always stayed with him and made very effort to prolong
his life but a ll was in vain. We had to part with father but joy was left to
our sad hearts that he left this home with an assurance of a grander home in
Heave.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

aught we know has lived a consistent member ever since. It is sad to chronicle
the death of our fellow men but a great consolation in knowing they have been
obedient tot he blessed Masters commandments and the subject was certainly one
of such. He was a victim in early life of that dreaded disease spinal
meningitis which left him a cripple for life but which he bore with the
greatest of patience and just a few days previous to his death he had a slight
attack of lagrippe no one thinking him dangerous on account of him being able
to walk out a short distance but medical assistance was summoned hoping to assist
in his recovery and at noon Thursday he seemed as usual just about ten minutes
before he was found to have passed to his long home. As he was subject to heart
failure we believe it to be the cause. He died at the home of his brother at

was born near Malaga, this county, June 22, 1819, and died at her home on South
Main street, August 22, 1913, being 94 years and 2 months of age. She was
united in marriage to William Cooper on January 13, 1840 and to this union were
born nine children all of whom and her husband have passed to that other shore,
excepting one daughter Mrs. James A. Skinner of Byesville, Ohio. Mrs. Cooper
has lived her entire life in Monroe county, having watched with interest its
growth and influence. Since her marriage she has resided in Woodsfield, and
with the exception of a few months has lived in the house in which she died.
Soon after coming to Woodsfield, under the pastorate of Rev. McIllyar, she was
converted and joined the Methodist Episcopal church. The class room was her
home, she delighted to tell of the wonderful love and the keeping power of the
Savior that she promised to love and obey, until He bid her take off the
earthly frame and enter that haven of rest that come to all who do His will.
Down even unto death she leaned upon the strong arm of one who is able to save
and keep until that day. The writer can recall her words of guidance and
thought, how her advice and motherly attention has been a part of his life. We
deeply feel our loss yet we bow in humble submission to the Divine will,
knowing that she has gone to a well earned repose. Death came as a result of
natural wasting away of the mortal body, and as she closed her eyes in that
last long sleep she bade those about her bedside a happy farewell and with the
words; e true to God and meet me in Heave the spirit returned to its maker.
Besides her daughter, Mrs. Skinner and husband, she leaves three grand
children, Leon B. James C. Skinner and Mrs. Bessie Schumacher. Two of her sons
served in the late war, John D. Being sacrificed on the field of battle. Her
other son returned but not until after he had been severely wounded.</span><span

Edward Easley, a farmer who resided on the Ohio side of the river in Monroe
county, Ohio, and who is alleged to have committed suicide by drowning himself
about three months ago. The body was grabbed up by the clam digger from the bed
of the river, where it had lain for the past three months, and was discovered
when the clam digger was opened to allow the gravel to be dumped into a barge.
The body was in a terrible state of decomposition on account of being in the
water so long. At the time that Easley disappeared from his home after attending
to the morning milking of the herd of cows on the farm, he was tracked to the
Ohio river and his foot prints showed where he entered the river.</span><span

brother and friendHarry C. Fisher. The demise though not unexpected, has cast
a gloom over the entire community, and especially is his demise felt by his
survivors and intimate friends.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Brother
Fisher having been so long a sufferer from a dreadful affliction, typhoid
fever, which for two months confined him to his home, room and bed, had he
deepest sympathy of all who personally knew him. We cannot adequately express
our sense of personal loss in the passing of friends. It is hard to reconcile
ourselves to these earthy partings. We cling to the companionship of by-gone
years, yet when we recall how long and how patiently our departed friend
suffered, while we instinctively cling to and believe in the life to come and
in a joyful reunion hereafter, we can rejoice that the days of suffering are
past, that he is resting in peace and honor, from the strain and worry of daily
life. In this belief we can here today say not in a spirit of desolation, but
in the abiding faith of an ultimate reunion that we have paid our respects to
him who has but departed this world to enter that beautiful world where sorrow
is no more. His examples and virtue are worthy our earnest emulation. May we go
live that when our summons comes, it may be said of us, as of Harry Fisher,
that we have lived a life of usefulness and purpose and have discharged our
duties to all humanity. Harry was prepared for the departure. He realized that
he soon would unite with Him who doeth all things well. Yet while his mortal
body is lying in the Silent city of the dead, he is not forgotten. Through
these words, I am ready, we have the assurance and consolation that Harry is
on the Lords side, as scripture says, Blessed are they that die in the Lord,
from henceforth eternity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:

1839. She was the daughter of James and Louisa Naylor Guthrie. In early years
after the death of her father, her mother and children moved to Woodsfield and
the deceased made her home here until her marriage to Mr. William Hume of
Belmont county which took place July 4, 1884. She and husband resided in
Belmont county until a short time before her husbands death when they came to
Woodsfield and took possession of her property here where her death occurred.
Mr. Hume died February 2, 191{illegible}. Mrs. Hume suffered a stroke of
paralysis some months ago but so much recovered that she went to Wheeling two
weeks ago on business and visited friends both there and in Belmont county. She
returned home a day or two before Christmas and fully enjoyed the day with
relatives at the home. Sunday morning although suffering with a cold, she was
able to be up and around and helped with the duties of the day. In the evening
she took suddenly worse and sank rapidly until death claimed her as his own.
Mrs. Hume was a member of the Presbyterian church and was a great student of
the Bible and was faithful to all her duties and said to the writer that she
was ready to go to her dear ones at any time and that death was not a thing to
be feared as God made it easy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

oclock conducted by her pastor Rev. Robert LeRyall assisted by Rev. Carlos
pastor of the First Methodist Episcopal church. The choir of the Presbyterian
church furnished appropriate music. Many and beautiful were the floral
offerings of relatives and friends. She leaves an only sister Mrs. M. A. Gibson
and many relatives and friends to mourn her taking away. By her request she was
laid to rest by the side of her mother in the old cemetery.</span><span

D. Keylor November 29, 1884. She united with the Evangelical church of Christ
at the age of 15 under Rev. Shemel of Lewisville, Ohio. She lived a life with
Christ for 34 years. She was afflicted with neuritis. Her life on earth was
short. The Saviour called her home. She leaves a devoted husband, three sons
and one daughter, one daughter having preceded her in infancy. Also, four
sisters and three brothers and a loving mother who will sadly miss her. Mother
was loving and of sweet disposition. She was a kind and obliging neighbor. She
was always willing and ready to lend a helping hand. None knew her but to love
her. She was the joy and pride of the home. The home will be lonely now as your
gather in the evening. When the long days work is done you will listen for the
footsteps of her whom we loved so well. Tears you will shed but not tears of
despair. A bow of hope spans the darkness of the grave. You have a mother in
heaven safely garnered from the trials of earth, saved perhaps from evil to
come. So dry your tears for if your eyes could be touched and for one moment
you could see your mothers surroundings the grand capacities and possibilities
of the life just freed from the trammels of earth your tears would be dried and
your faces would glow with the light no seen on sea or shore. Trials may come
to you but none can happen mother upon whose lips Jesus has pressed the kiss of
peace. Pass under the rod and you will find it held by a fathers hand. The
funeral services were Thursday morning June 19, 1913 conducted by Rev. Klutey,
pastor of the Evangelical church of Lewisville. The body was laid to rest in
the beautiful cemetery at Hope Ridge where so many of our loved ones sleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Monroe county, Ohio, Dec. 27, 1840, and died at the home of her son Odell
Leisure June 7, 1913, aged 72 years, 6 months and 18 days. She was united in
marriage to John Leisure in 1860. To this union were born 9 children. The
husband and two children have preceded her to the great beyond. There is left
to mourn the departure of a sister and mother, two brothers, Nelson Morris and
William Morris of Coakley, W.Va. And of the children living are Mrs. Mary Okey,
Ethel, Ohio, Willis E. Leisure, Summerfield, Nelson W., Leisure, Summerfield,
Charles E. Leisure, Caldwell, Mrs. Harriett House, Summerfield, Mrs. Emma Oden,
Woodsfield, and Odell Leisure of the home. There are also 24 grand children of
whom 2 are living and 3 great grand children, and almost a countless host of
relatives and friends to mourn her departure.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the United Brethren church over 40 years ago. Sometime after she changed her
membership to the Mt. Tabor M.E. church, where she remained a consistent church
worker during the remainder of her life. She bore her suffering with the
greatest of patience and christian fortitude was genial and kind to all, but on
account of her affliction and age was deprived of attending religious services
for many years. Such a life was a blessing and benediction to all within the
sphere of its influence. So is the death of such a one a public misfortune as
well as an irreparable loss to the home made desolate by her departure. None
ever entered her home without a warm welcome, nor left without feeling the
warmth of a genuine hospitality. Her work is ended, her suffering past when she
passed away so calm and peaceful without a struggle leaving her dear ones and
friends to welcome them in heaven where separation never comes. With almost her
last breath her last words and request was to her children, she was ready to
meet her Savior and for them all to meet her in heave. Her last act was to
repeat two stanzas of theat beautiful song, Going home to die no more.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of Blanche the dearly beloved daughter of Mr. and Mrs. William Longfellow,
quietly departed from its earthly dwelling place to see k the bright, the
heavenly goal where none shall know sorrow, where none shall weep. It was the
privilege of the writer to know Blanche for years and found that she was lovely
in her person, amiable in her disposition, dutiful as a daughter, kind as a
sister, and beloved by all her associates. In her last illness, which was long
and painful, no murmur or complaint was heard; but with perfect resignation
submitted to the will of divine Providence. Thus in calm tranquility without
the first fear or doubt upon her mind, passed away the last days of our dear
Blanche. She was a good girl and was loved by all with whom she came in
contact, always courteous and kind and performing her home duties with care,
always trying to save her dear afflicted mother all she could. All though her
sickness her one thought seemed to be to save her parents all the worry she
could and seemed to ever realize the text of scripture. It is more blessed to
give than to receive. Such characters are few and when they leave the scenes of
their varied usefulness to take their chamber in the silent halls of Death
they leave a vacancy, a loss that is felt by everyone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

chairs of the former and was elected Representative to Grand Lodge which was
held at Columbus, Ohio, in June, but being too sick to attend.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

from the earthly life and went to be forever with the Lord April 17<sup>th</sup>,
1913, aged 8 years and 3 months. His life on earth was short. Before his heart
had learned in waywardness to stray, before his feet had ever turned the dark
and downward way, the Savior called him home. He leaves father, mother, one
brother and two sisters, who will sadly miss him. Charles was bright, manly and
of sweet disposition. He was the joy and pride of the home. The home will be
lonely now, as you gather in the evening, when the long days work is done, you
will listen for the voice and footsteps of the boy you loved so well: Tears you
will shed but not tears of despair. A bow of hope, spans the darkness of the
grave. You have a boy in heaven, safely garnered from the trials of earth saved
perhaps from evil to come. So dry your tears. For if your eyes could be touched
and for one moment you could see your boys surroundings, the grand capacities
and possibilities of the life just freed from the trammels of earth your tears
would be dried and your faces would glow with the light no seen on sea or
shore. Trails may come to you, but none can happen to Charles upon whose lips
Jesus has pressed the kiss of peace. Pass under the rod and you will find it
held by a Fathers hand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was received here Monday written by a devoted and loving daughter who with a
heart, crushed penned the words that told us of her great, great loss. Margaret
Jane Smith was born at Waynesburg, Pa., May 13, 1838. She was united in
marriage to William F. Randolph (who died in 1902) December 17, 1856, and died
at her home in Blanchester, Ohio, April 15, 1913, leaving four children to
mourn the loss of an unselfish, self-sacrificing mother. She died very suddenly
although she had been an invalid for several years and had failed greatly in
the last few months but was able to be up and about the house. She united with
the Methodist Episcopal Church when quite young and lived a faithful member
during life and when the end came she was prepared and it was a peaceful and
blessed release to her from weakness and distress, and a happy reunion with her
dear ones gone before. As days go by she is missed more and more
especially<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>by the blind son, who was
with her constantly, and her daughter Julia whose tender care prolonged her
life. Her old friends of Woodsfield remember her by her kindness and gentleness
and although they have not seen her for years, were greatly grieved to hear of
her passing away. She was the mother of Miss Elizabeth F. Randolph who was for
many months with us here, and an aunt by marriage of Mrs. William C. Mooney.<span

1913, Barbara Roth. Mrs. Roth was born at Miltonsburg, Ohio, April 3, 1839, to
Mr. and Mrs. H. J. Roos and was early dedicated to her Lord in baptism and at
the age of 15 she duly assumed her vows in confirmation in the Protestant
Evangelical church of Miltonsburg. In 1865 she was united in marriage to
Christian Roth. This union was blessed with 10 children, six sons and four
daughters, of whom five sons and two daughters survive their mother. Her
husband was called from her side March 16, 1896. In her later years she has
been making her home with two of her sons, until she came to Woodsfield last
winter. She rushed to the aid of her daughter when sickness and death hovered
near but hardly had she begun to comfort, when she who had come to minster
needed the ministrations others. She was taken sick and never recovered until
the Master mercifully called her home. Her sickness was to her a reminder of
the brevity of life and she used it as a time of preparation for the eternity
to come. Two weeks before her death she desired the Sacrament of Holy
Communion, which was given unto her; and in her conversations with her children
she assured them that she was prepared to die and bade them farewell for now
but not forever. She finally passed into rest on Monday afternoon July 14
awaiting the awakening at the call of the trumpets on the day of resurrection,
when all those who died in the Lord shall be joined together with Him and
remain with Him forever. Her numerous friends and relatives join with her children
in mourning her death and praying God for His consolation in a time of need.

Armstrongs Mills, Belmont county. Alva A. Smith, son of Mr. And Mrs. John
Smith, of Woodsfield route 2, was instantly killed while pumping an oil well
for the Natural Gas Company of Wheeling, W.Va. No person being present at the
time of the accident, it is not known just how it happened, but it is supposed
that while he was putting belt dressing on the pulley his clothing caught in
the clutch and wound him around the pulley and crushed his head. He went to the
well between two and three oclock in the afternoon to look after the well
which had been running all day and was found lying on the floor of the engine
house at 6:20 oclock in the evening by a Mr. P. Blaker who had been to his
boarding house and as Alva had not come to supper he supposed something was
wrong and went to the well and found him. Mr. Blaker called to John A. Nalley,
an uncle of smith, by telephone who went to his assistance at once and moved
his mangled body to his home, where his remains were prepared for burial by an
undertaker at Jacobsburg and was brought to his home Tuesday, Aug, 26, and was
interred Wednesday at Mouse Ridge cemetery followed to his last resting pace by
a large concourse of sorrowing friends and relatives. Mr. Evans, who is one of
the company that Alva was working for and also Mr. Minear, who is field boss,
closed down all the work in the field and brought all of their men to Woodsfield
and attended the funeral in a body and furnished a large lot of fine flowers as
a token of their respect.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

There she grew to womanhood. In 1852 she was united in marriage to Charles

seven daughters. Six of the daughters were present at their mothers bed side

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:

from the commencement of her protracted and discomforting sickness was she able
to leave her room. She fully realized that she could never recover and that
even temporary relief could not be given to her; but for hours, days, nights,
months, years, she bore with the sublime Christian resignation her severe
affliction. She was wiling to undergo greater physical and mental distress,
should Providence will it. During all those tryng years her devoted daughter
Mrs. Losey cared for her, consoled her, and stove as best she could to make her
as comfortable as possible. How she stood so well the severe strain under which
she labored was a surprise indeed to her friends and neighbors. There are
perhaps few cases in history in which a daughter did more for a loving mother.
Now that Mrs. Yockey is gone, what a consolation to the attentive, patient,
affectionate daughter to realize that she so much to lighten her sorrow. If the
giving of a cup of cold water to one of Gods little ones, in his name, is not
to go unrewarded; what blessings<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>there
