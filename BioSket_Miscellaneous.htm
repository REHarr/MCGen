was born on the farm now known as the <b>MAURY</b> Farm, on Sunfish creek, in
Salem township, Monroe county, OH (owned then by his father, Jeremiah <b>WALTON</b>)
and the 2<sup>nd</sup> day of September 1836; and at the age of seven years,
his father left his residence on the farm and moved his family to the town of
Clarington, on the Ohio river, where he engaged in the practice of medicine for
six years, during which time Richard was sent to school regularly to such
teachers as were then to be employed under the earlier school regime.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At the age of 13, Richard was removed by his
father back to the farm on which he was born; and from that time he labored on
the farm, under the direction of his father, who for many years afterwards
continued in his practice, as a successful physician.<span style="mso-spacerun:

terms, which were short, lasting each winter about four months.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In this way he, by close application, became
well versed in the common branches of English learning, and at the age of 19
procured a certificate to teach in the common schools.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>His first advent into the school room, armed
with his first certificate, was in the fall of 1855; wages, thirty dollars per
month; length of term six months.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>With
the proceeds of his first winter’s labor in the school room, he, by the consent
of his father, attended a school at Woodsfield, OH, taught by William <b>WHEELER</b>,
the next summer and fall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The former
years labor in the same schoolroom was repeated the following year, and he
again attended two terms of school at Woodsfield, taught by Professor John <b>MOORE</b>,
who was an instructor of great ability and learning; after which, on the 15<sup>th</sup>
day of June 1858, he was married to Julia A. <b>CONGER</b>, the youngest
daughter of Elias &amp; Margaret <b>ATKINSON</b> <b>CONGER</b>, of Monroe
county, OH; taught school for one year following his marriage, at Cameron, in
Adams township, and afterwards in various districts of Adams and other
townships of the county, when in 1861 he was appointed school examiner by
Probate Judge <b>SINCLAIR</b>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the
fall of 1862 he was chosen by the board of education of the Clarington special
school district principal of the Clarington school; resigned the office of
school examiner in the spring of 1863, and thereafter removed, at the close of
one term of school at Clarington, to his father’s farm in Adams township, where
he spent the most of his time for two years following, reading law under the
instruction of the Hon. William F. <b>HUNTER</b>, of Monroe county, OH; after
which he was again called by the board of education to labor as principal in
the Clarington school, at which place he was employed as principal of the
school, with the exception of one term, for 10 years.<span style="mso-spacerun:

children were born in his family, four of which, two sons and two daughters,

of teaching, and meeting with success in this calling for more than 20 years,
and being solicitious for a change from the school-room, he became a candidate
for the office of probate judge, to which he was elected in the fall of 1878,
and afterward, in the fall of 1881, was reelected to a second term of said
office, of which he is now the incumbent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
