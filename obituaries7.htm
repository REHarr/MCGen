Woodsfield, a freshman at Monroe Central High School, was killed after school
Thursday, two miles north of Woodsfield on Ohio 26, when he apparently lost

his wife, Julia; parents, Earl and Tressa Hissom; brother, Charles and George;
and sisters, Mary Graham, Elizabeth Cash, Betty Atkins and Carol Ross. Rev.
Earl Jr. was a minister, evangelist and religious leader in West Virginia. He
was converted and called to preach at age 17 in a tent meeting being conducted
by his father, Earl G. Hissom Sr., located at the corner of Madison and
Randolph Streets, the current location of Sav-A-Lot and Agsten Manor. Before
joining the Church of the Nazarene in 1945, the Rev. Hissom sold Bibles, held
tent meetings, conducted revivals and preached whenever and wherever he could.
He then pastored at Uneeda and Seth. When the Seth church was organized into a
Nazarene Church by District Superintendent Dr. Oney, he lost his pastorate. Dr.
Oney said, &quot;That's okay, son. Don't be upset. The Church of the Nazarene
has lots of places for you to preach.&quot; And they kept him busy the next 25
years, pasturing in Seth, New Martinsville, Glasgow, Weirton, Southeast Nazarene
and Capitol View Nazarene in Charleston. He also served as an evangelist.
During the years that he pastored for the Church of the Nazarene, the Rev.
Hissom was able to report gains in all departments with all budgets paid. At
every pastorate, he made notable capital improvements to church properties. He
served on various boards and committees of the West Virginia District of the
Church of the Nazarene. The Rev. Hissom was instrumental in planting several
Holiness churches, including Burnsville, Ohio, Paris, Pa., Handley, Hooverson
Heights, Colliers Way, Capitol View (now known as South Hills Church of the
Nazarene) and the Church of Emmanuel in Charleston, and Gap Mills. The Rev.
Hissom served as a mentor and encourager for many young, aspiring ministers,
such as John Hancock, Harold Runyon, Carl Gray, James Withrow, Paul Nester,
Tony Costello and many others. During a recent telephone call, Mrs. John
Hancock expressed their deep appreciation for the tremendous amount of time the
Rev. Hissom spent with them in their early Christian lives. After his
retirement from the Nazarene Church, the Rev. Hissom operated a Bible selling
business, pastored the Hissom Holiness Tabernacle and the Church of Emmanuel,
Charleston, and Harry Peyton Tabernacle, Hinton. He continued to hold revivals
across the state of West Virginia, preach whenever and wherever he was called
and frequently conducted radio broadcasts. He also worked as a fundraiser
throughout the state for fire and police departments, emergency services and
health clinics through RMJ Studios. The Rev. Hissom was a renowned Bible
scholar. His favorite pastime was studying the Bible, preparing sermons and
discussing the scriptures. His hobbies were walking, hunting and watching old
westerns on TV.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

relax by playing golf at Portage Country Club, where he was a member. He worked
on his game with a passion, said Rod Johnston, longtime golf pro at Portage.
``He loved his golf. Even when his swing was deteriorating as he got older,
he'd be out working on it,'' Johnston said. Mr. Buchholzer attended the club's
annual golf trip to Palm Springs, Calif., several years. One year, Mr.
Buchholzer had a heart attack there. During the following year's trip, Mr. Buchholzer
rented out a restaurant to entertain and thank all of the medical professionals
who contributed to his recovery. ``That's just the way he was,'' Johnston said.
``Always thinking about others.'' Family friend and attorney Robert Malone
agreed. ``He never talked about himself,'' he said. ``He was a great
gentleman.''<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

started working for his father (JJ), who owned Hower Department Store in East
Akron. Over the years he and his father forged a dynamic team of retailing,
business, and real estate development. In the late 1940s they began acquiring
land for development in strategic parts of the Akron area. After the loss of
his father, Dick, with his partners, Forest City Enterprises, developed and
opened Chapel Hill Mall in 1964, which Dick managed. The mall became known as
``The Friendliest Mall of All.&quot; Rolling Acres Mall was opened in 1975.
Other commercial and residential properties were also developed. <o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
