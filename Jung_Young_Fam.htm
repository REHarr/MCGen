mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt'>JUNG / YOUNG FAMILY BACKGROUND<o:p></o:p></span></u></b></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Johann Michael* Jung (May 13, 1802 - December
9, 1879) was born in Rumbach, Germany to Johann Michael* Jung (1776 - Feb. 24,
1851) and Maria Elisabeth* Rucklos (1779 - July 11, 1852). He was the second
oldest child and the oldest son in a family of 5 children. His older sister,
Philippina Jung was born December 23, 1800. Johann Michael* Jung (May 13, 1802
- December 9, 1879) and his family, were the immigrants who transplanted our
Jung/Young family from Germany to America. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>The Jung family in Germany had been a family
of weavers and during most of Michael's life, times had been hard. Michael (May
13, 1802 - December 9, 1879) had been born at a time when Germany was highly
fractionated into over 300 small states and principalities. Napoleon had risen
to power and was in the process of conquering Germany and most of Europe. By
the time Michael was 10 years old, Napoleon had been defeated. Germany had been
largely consolidated into a few larger states and a police-state government had
been established that severely repressed the population.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>In 1854, within 2 years after his mother,
Maria Elisabeth* Rucklos (1779 - July 11, 1852) died, Michael (May 13, 1802 -
December 9, 1879) converted all of his family's assets into cash and emigrated
to America. Over the preceding 2 or 3 decades many families from his community
had already immigrated to America. Michael was therefore immigrating to a new
German colony of his peers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>The 1870 U.S. Federal census lists Michael
Young, 68 years old, from Bavaria as a weaver.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>The death record of Michael Young lists his
date of death as Dec 9, 1879. His age on this date was 77 years, 5 months and
26 days. Back calculating his date of birth from the death record data does not
agree with the German record of his birth date by one month. It would appear
that his age should have been given as 77 years, 6 months and 26 days. This
might have been a simple mistake made when his age was calculated at the time
of his death. I have elected to use the date of birth which came from
information that was supplied on his family church record from Germany.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>According to the German Church records the
date of birth for Michael Young was May 23, 1802. Also, the date of marriage in
this reference is given as November 2, 1827 in Rumbach, Germany<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>I found in a document titled &quot;Passenger
and Immigration Lists Index&quot; in the Carnegie Library at the University of
Pittsburgh, Pa, the following entry: aboard the REGULATOR from Havre to New
York on 04 August 1854:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Michael Young bought 80 acres of land from
Herman Hahn on Oct 11, 1855. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Caroline Jung (May 19, 1832 - ?) married
Georg Jacob Zimmerle (April 27, 1830 - ?) on November 15, 1855. Georg Jacob
Zimmerle went by the name of Jacob. The records of three German churches
(Lewisville, Miltonsburg and a church located between the two called Middle
Church -- these records were translated and published by </span><a
href="churches3.htm"><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Dr. Shirley Harmon</span></a><span
style='font-size:13.5pt'>) indicate that Jacob Zimmerle landed America in 1836
having come from Grafenhausen, Germany, north of Annweiler. This same record
indicates that Jacob and his wife Caroline moved to Tennessee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Salome Jung (July 23, 1836 - ?) married Jacob
Bott (July 29, 1835 - ?) on April 16, 1862. [There is some uncertainty
regarding whether this is the correct Jacob Bott who married Salome Jung. She
married a Jacob Bott, but the records show at least another Jacob Bott of about
the same age. All circumstantial evidence seems to point to this being the
correct Jacob Bott.] The record of Jacob and Salome Jung Bott appears to end
with their marriage. It would appear that Salome and her husband may have left
Monroe County after being married.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>For completeness of the historical record of
the Michael Jung family, it should be noted that Caroline and Salome had an
older brother, Frederick Jung / Young (December 23, 1830 - February 4, 1912)
who was the great, great grandfather of the author. Frederick Young immigrated
to America in the spring of 1854, about 3 months ahead of his parents and two sisters.
He went to Monroe County where there were a number of his friends and relatives
from the Rumbach, Germany area. On May 20, 1856 Frederick Young married Eva
Pfeiffer who lived with her parents about a mile away from the Young farm that
Frederick and his father bought near Lewisville, Ohio. Frederick and Eva
(Pfeiffer) Young had 8 children, one of whom was Louisa Young (1863 - 1913) the
author's great grandmother.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Fred Young's headstone in the cemetery at
Lewisville, OH shows his date of birth to be Dec 23, 1829. Frederick's death
certificate shows his date of birth to be December 23, 1830.</span><u><span
