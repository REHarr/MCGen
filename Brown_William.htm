JOHN BROWN The history of the Brown Family dates back in this country to one
William Brown, who came to the United States from Ireland and settled in <a

His father, supposed to be of Scotch ancestry, lived and died in <st1:country-region

It was to avoid being persecuted by the Catholics in the North of Ireland that
William Brown and his brother Matthew came to <a

who had also come from Ireland, at the age of fourteen, while her husband at
the time of his arrival was eighteen years old. Some years after their marriage
they went to <a

their home. It was very wild there then; Indians were present in the county,
and it was to the redskins that William Brown owed his early death. Together
with his oldest son and two other men, he was helping to move a family to the
fort when the Indians waylaid them and killed all but the son, who escaped by
swimming a stream, fell exhausted, and was under medical treatment for the next
seven years, having been shot through the back, the bullet passing out at the
fifth rib. He lived to be an old man and reared a large family. After the
Indian troubles of which we speak he went to <a

making a specialty of the latter. His land is under a good state of cultivation

commodious residence which is finely located and occupying a rise of ground
commanding a fine view of the surrounding country for eighteen miles away. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

coming on of the Civil War interfered considerably with his first plans in

Infantry and marched with his comrades to the scene of conflict. Going down
into <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Tennessee</st1:place></st1:State>,
they were first engaged in the attempted capture of Gen. Price, who, however,
escaped that time. Our subject served his term of enlistment, and although
meeting the enemy at different times and places, was neither wounded nor taken
prisoner, and his health was preserved to such an extent that he was always
able to report for duty. After retiring from the service he engaged as a
