the newspaper business in the late nineteenth century.<span

frequently survival.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>From these brief
notes it is easier to understand some of the bluntness of comments found by
reading some of these old papers and the biting comments that appear in the
newspaper clippings contained in Paul E. Young, Jr.     s document titled, <b>     </b></span></i><b><i><span

Democratic paper, owned and edited by W. M. Williams of Woodsfield, Ohio, was
launched in the Journalistic field October 11, 1906, on which date the first
number appeared.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>Its appearance was the
result of a popular sentiment on the part of the people of the county in favor
of a paper that would be free from the domination of all financial or political
influence, so that issues both local and national might be discussed in its
columns without fear or favor, and in the interest of the masses; also, a paper
that would tend to foster and encourage public sentiment in favor of our public
schools, that both teachers and pupils might be inspired to higher ideals of
life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>During its short life it has
fully justified the confidence reposed in it by the supporters, as is evidenced
by its constantly growing subscription list, and the general favor with which
it has been received.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

taking charge says,      In all our eighteen years experience in the newspaper
business we never saw such vindictive pure hatred manifested against a
newspaper, as has been brought to bear against this one from the first number
that it was issued.     <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>Mr. Goodrich continued

public sale by Mrs. O. O. Snyder, who sold it to Jennings, Walton and Reef, who
on August 16, 1906, under the new management, brought it back to its first
love.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>In a few weeks both Jennings and
