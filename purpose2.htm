<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Of the many hundreds of thousand of
life-forms that inhabit this world of ours that we call </span><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span><span
style='font-size:13.5pt'>Earth,</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:
"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt'> it appears
that man is the only one to possess an ability to accumulate knowledge, learn
from it, and to build upon it. While this process of accumulating knowledge
takes many forms, we generally refer to the process by which it occurs as
history. One focus of this history is genealogy. Webster defines genealogy as <b><i>being
a recorded history of one</i></b></span><b><i><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span></i></b><b><i><span
style='font-size:13.5pt'>s ancestry; the study of family descent</span></i></b><span
style='font-size:13.5pt'>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Man has done a fairly good job recording his
history and accumulating knowledge. Ironically, however, people seldom record
for posterity the events of their own lives. It usually remains for the
genealogist and historian to sort through records, newspapers, memories, and
whatever information they can find to retrospectively create the recorded
history of one</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>=</span><span
style='font-size:13.5pt'>s ancestry. This process is viewed in many ways by
genealogists who have alternately described it as being interesting, laborious,
captivating, time consuming, rewarding, tedious, addictive and many other
adjectives. But, the best genealogists among us are never quite able to capture
the personalities of their subjects. Only faceless facts are found among the
trails that are left behind which are often in hidden resources tucked away in
musty courthouses, in newspaper morgues and various other places.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Undaunted by the difficulties they encounter
the genealogist, who is frequently just a curious kin interested in discovering
a little more about themselves and their family, must press ahead. Most
frequently they will read guidance that has been placed in the literature by
more experienced researchers to try to discover the optimum methods for
searching. They will go to the record books that have been opened thousands of
times by an equal number of researchers pursuing their own ancestry. They will
rediscover for the thousandth time the records that exist; the fact that certain
records were lost to fire; the facts that their family line may have been
previously researched; and that certain brick walls exist that seem to bring
their search to a dead end. They may make the same mistakes of data
interpretation or discover work-arounds and leads that may have been previously
discovered by others. WouldnÂ’t it be great if a resource were available to help
the new and experienced genealogist find their way through the genealogical
thicket in an efficient way?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Well, there is such a resource. One of the
ways that the genealogy community has found to improve their efficiency, limit
their work, share their processes and methodologies, and share their
experiences is to form organizations to help focus their efforts. The Monroe
County Chapter of the Ohio Genealogical Society (MCC of OGS) is one such group
serving the Monroe County Ohio area.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>The purpose of the MCC of OGS is to promote
genealogy and preserve genealogical data in our County. We share information
with others that may be the link to your family roots. MCC of OGS welcomes
all-comers whether members or visitors. We maintain several resources that are
available to members and visitors that include a well stocked library, a free
web site, and courteous, friendly officers and staff to help you. MCC of OGS
can help to provide a focus for your research through these and other resources
and through help provided by Chapter members and our friendly officers and
staff. Certain additional benefits are available to members such as the award
winning newsletter that is published quarterly, the opportunity to participate
in the First Family and the Pioneer Family programs, the ability to place your
queries in the newsletter at no cost, and more. The additional benefits of
being a member are certainly well worth the small annual membership fee of $10
per year.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
