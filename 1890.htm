<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>              </span>During his illness he was
constantly attended by his old army comrades, whose names in his illness he
often called and who bore for him the most profound respect and admiration.<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>              </span>Short exercises were
conducted at the residence, and more extended services at the Church led by his
pastor, Rev. Moen, assisted by his neighbor and friend Uriah Cleary. The G. A.
R. of which deceased was a member, took charge of the funeral rites and amid a
storm of snow and sleet his mortal remains were interred with the beautiful
burial services of the fraternity. No man in the community had more earnest,
sincere friends; no man was more deserving of the closest, sweetest ties of
friendship; he was an unselfish, broad minded, great hearted, noble, manly man.
He will be greatly missed in business, fraternal and social circles, and except
his devoted wife and children, by no one more than by the writer, HIS BROTHER.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Jan. 19, 1890.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When 15 years of age he
removed from West Va. with his fathers family and located on Sunfish Creek
four miles West of Woodsfield where he passed the greater part of his life. <br>
On the 15<sup>th</sup> day of June, 1827, he was married to Mary Daily of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Calais</st1:City></st1:place>.
For nearly 63 years they journeyed this life together. They were blessed with
twelve children, eight sons and two daughters. Just half of them, four sons and
two daughters, preceded him to the better country and four sons and two
daughters with his aged companion remain to mourn his loss.<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>              </span>Coming to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:State w:st="on">Ohio</st1:State></st1:place>,
as he did, in early days, he of course found it a wilderness, but not being
afraid to work, he did his part in changing it from a home for wild beasts to a
place of pleasant farms. Soon after the close of the war he fell in with the
tide of immigration toward the West, and in the spring of 1870 he closed up his
business in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Monroe</st1:PlaceName>
<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">County</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> and came west and
settled on the farm where he spent the remainder of his life. About the year
1840, he gave his heart to God and united with the M. E. Church. For many years
he was class leader and steward. His daily life adorned the profession he made.
Although during his last illness he suffered much, the last 24 hours of his
life was almost free from pain. At <st1:time Hour="12" Minute="0" w:st="on">noon</st1:time>,
on the 19<sup>th</sup> of January, leaving a beautiful smile on his

able and faithful member; the family, a kind and loving husband and father.But
what is our loss is his gain.<br>

the bones. They were gathered in a sleigh-box, and deposited in a public hall. <br>

two miles west of Beallsville, Monroe County, Ohio, November 15<sup>th</sup>,
1890, Alexander C. Hutchinson, in the seventy ninth year of his age.<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>              </span>The deceased was born in
Washington Co., <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:State w:st="on">Pennsylvania</st1:State></st1:place>,
<st1:date Year="1811" Day="25" Month="6" w:st="on">June 25<sup>th</sup>, 1811</st1:date>.
In the year 1838 he left his home and friends and came to Beallsville, then
regarded as the far west. There he engaged in tanning, a trade he had learned
on a farm adjoining his father.<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>              </span>In the year 1840 he was
united in marriage to Rachel Nelson, who died in the year 1855 after a
lingering illness from that disease consumption. She died the death of a
Christian, having early in life united herself with the Presbyterian Church of
Beallsville, and lived a life that removed all the terrors of death, The union
was blessed with four sons and two daughters, two sons, James and Willie and
one daughter, Samantha, had crossed the river in advance of their mother. Two
sons, John Nelson and Chalmers A. and one daughter were left with the father to
mourn his loss.<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>              </span>In the year 1857 he was
again united in marriage to Eleanor Beardmore, an excellent Christian woman who
still survives to mourn his loss. Of this union there were born one son Ross L.
and one daughter, Clara H; both of whom remained with their father to bless and
cheer him in his declining years. In the spring time of life gave his heart
[sic-heart] to Christ<br>
And united with the Presbyterian Church of Beallsville of which he remained a
member until his death.<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>              </span>He was known throughout the
county in which he lived as a God fearing man and one who under all
circumstances was ready and willing to give testimony of the faith that was in
him. He was a man of decided views and strong affections and fully manifested
the spirit of daily walk and conversation. He truly took his Lord as Shepherd
and in prayer often repeated the first two or three verses of the 23<sup>rd</sup>
Psalm, which was one of his favorite reference of the book which he took as his
daily guide. His early life was active and he was very successful in business
and accumulated a large amount of this worlds goods of which he freely gave to
support that Gospel to which he was a devoted believer.<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>              </span>He moved to the farm on
which he resided at his death in the year 1857 and continued in active control
of the same until about five years ago when he gave up the management to his
son. Since then he has spent his time enjoying a well earned rest and more
fully preparing himself for that change which he felt would soon come. He often
and cheerfully talked of death, not as one without hope but with that calm and
blessed assurance of a Christian who feels that all is well. He said that he
knew that to die was but to live and that it was far better to die and be with
Christ than to live beyond the allotted time for man and be filled with sorrow
and pain. He had all his life enjoyed unusual health, never having lain on a
sick bed an entire day during his long useful life, and death came to him in so
peaceful a manner that he passed away without a pain. Having arisen from his
chair and lay down upon his couch, he soon, surrounded by his family fell
asleep in Jesus. His life was an example of one who from youth to old age had
always gleaned from the Book of life its most precious treasures and retained
them as evidence of Gods goodness to those who love him and serve him. He had
passed through that dark valley and shadow of death of which he so often spoke.
<br>
His patriarchal face and form has gone from amongst us and his footsteps will
be heard no more in the church below, but we feel assured that he is now
singing the song of Moses and the Lamb in the church triumphant around the

the husband never was known to lose his vigilance, and ever stood ready to
minister with love and tenderness to her many wants. Thus having done all in
his power for her comfort and relief, he calmly submitted to the decree, that
it is appointed once for man to die, and after that the judgement.<br>

in Gods word, which teaches that those who die in the Lord will have part in
the first resurrection of which the second death has no power.<br>

O.The present holiday season, so bright and joyous, has not passed unmarked by
accident and sorrow. The merry chimes that ushered in the New Year, 1890, were
all to suddenly followed by the mournful death knell. The Church so lately
thronged by a gay crowd in the height of enjoyment, is immediately re-opened to
admit a silent, coffined form, followed by friends, in the depth of grief;
faces so lately sparkling with gladness are awe stricken and eyes are misty
with sympathetic tears, as the words, In the midst of life we are in death,
falls with awful reality on listening ears. Death in its mildest form brings
nothing but anguish to the hearts of kindred and friend, even when they are
prepared for the parting by noting day after day the certain decay of the
beloved object, when permitted to hold even down to the cold brink of the dark
River the fond hand, and receive the last lingering look of recognition from
the death-dimmed eyes, but when the Reaper comes unannounced, and cuts down
unwarned, and alone our dear one, the shock is terrible, and in our blind grief
we cry, Too Cruel!, yet faith bids us know the Father can not mean cruelty.
On Thursday morning, Henry McConnell, a well known farmer living on the ridge
south of town, and a young married man of perhaps 28 to 30 years met his death
at his own hand. The facts, so far as we have learned, are as follows: On the
morning in question he told his wife he guessed he would go to Ullmans grocery
at <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Sycamore</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Valley</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
for some tobacco, took down his gun to shoot any game that might come in his
way, and started, saying he would be back soon. As the meal hour drew near, his
wife becoming anxious at his prolonged absence, finally went to a neighbors and
communicated her fears, but they assured her he would be home all right, but
evening came and no returning husband. She then went and besought his fathers
family to go in search of him. They went to Sycamore and learning he had not
been there, returned thoroughly alarmed, and arousing the neighbors went on
another search. The party took different routes through woods and field. A
young boy of Mr. Luburgs, in jumping over a fence not more than five minutes
walk from deceaseds home, jumped on the prostate body. His screams of terror
brought the searchers to the scene, and after examination, arrived to the
conclusion that on mounting the fence, a railwhich was found on the bodyhad
slipped, throwing him and causing the gun to go off, the ball penetrating near
the naval, passing upward near the heart causing instant death. His hand
pressed the wound, his mouth was open with his tobacco still in it when found.
It was about <st1:time Hour="20" Minute="0" w:st="on">8 oclock p.m.</st1:time>,
when he was found. His remains were brought here at <st1:time Hour="12" Minute="0" w:st="on">12
oclock</st1:time> Saturday and taken to the M. E. Church, where a funeral
discourse was preached by Rev. Floyd, after which they were followed by an
immense number of sympathetic friends. But words of condolence and sympathy are
meaningless to the stricken young wife and the fatherless little ones, the aged
father and mother and brothers and sisters. We can only say to them and others:<br>
.<br>
So live that when the summons comes to you<br>
To join the innumerable caravan that moves<br>
To that mysterious real where each shall take<br>
His chamber in the silent halls of death,<br>
Thou go not like the quarry slave at night<br>
Scourged to his dungeon, but sustained and soothed<br>
By an unfaltering trust approach the grave<br>
Like one who draws the drapery of his couch<br>
About him and lies down to pleasant dreams.<br>
.<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>              </span>E`re the obsequies of this
sad funeral was over, the somber wings of the dread messenger darkened the door
of another home north of town, and out from F. M. Robinsons two angels went
out where only one entered, and the tired gentle spirit of patient little
Willie was born from the pain-racked frame of mortality to Abrams bosom. He
was a particular bright, winning little one of 6 years, and greatly beloved.
His terrible sufferings for many months had the more endeared him to the
parents, to whom our hearts go out in sincerest sympathy.<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>              </span>Funeral at 1 oclock on
Sunday, conducted by Rev. Floyd, after which the remains were laid away in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Mt.</st1:PlaceType>

Mrs. Catharine Neuhart, nee Schaub, a native of <st1:country-region w:st="on">Prussia</st1:country-region>,
<st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Germany</st1:country-region></st1:place>,
was born on the 24th of February 1823. She immigrated to this country in 1835,
and made her home in <st1:City w:st="on">Summit</st1:City> township, <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Monroe
County</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Ohio</st1:State></st1:place>. On the
24th day of May 1842, she was married to Mr. John Michael Neuhart. Eleven
children were given to them in this marriage, of whom 10 follow the mother to
the grave. One has preceded her into eternity by death. Three months ago she
went to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Wheeling</st1:City></st1:place>
to attend to the wants of her sick daughter, Amelia, after whose convalescence,
she started on her way home. While on the train, she became very sick, and upon
arriving in Woodsfield, she was laid upon her fatal bed of illness and for four
weeks she suffered until released by death. Her death occurred on Sunday
morning, May 4, 1890, thus reaching the age of 67 years, 2 months, and 10 days.
She suffered from a contracted cold, which finally resulted in typhoid fever. On
Sunday morning, she had a stroke of paralysis from the effects of which she
passed from time to eternity. She has been a consistent member of the German M.
E. Church, and remained as such until her death, from which she now has entered
into her reward. She leaves hosts of relatives and friends who feel keenly the
loss they have sustained. The number of those present at the funeral shows to
what extent she was esteemed and respected in her social surroundings. Although
dark, stormy, rainy clouds hover over head all day and finally the rain poured
down in heavy showers. Friends and relatives gathered together from far and
near to pay the last honors of love and friendship to her. She died a Christian
and as we believe in the training of faith, God bless the bereaved ones and
heal their wounded hearts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F.&nbsp;</span><span

<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>              </span>Editor of Spirit: We have
recently been the recipients of kind favors and attention, both for ourselves
and our dear deceased, that we feel constrained to give expression by this
public mention.<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>              </span>A few weeks since we
received dispatches announcing the severe illness of our son Albert at the
point near <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Wooster</st1:City></st1:place>,
O., where he had been living for some four years past. We started to his
bedside, first the father, and next the mother, a week later, where we found
him kindly cared for in the home of Mr. Wilmot Snyder. Also very kind attention
was given by Grandma Webb and her daughter, Miss Mary during the five weeks of
our sons illness. If he had been a near relative we could not have expected
more kindly treatment and attention. Mrs. Foltz, Mrs. Wilmot, Snyders mother, is
one of the kindest ladies we have ever known. As a mother indeed she cared for
Albert, both in health and in sickness. Also many others in the vicinity
manifested much sympathy and showed us much of kind attention, bringing
beautiful flowers to the sick room and doing all in their power to alleviate
and comfort the sick and suffering one. But with all the careful treatment and
attention of his physician, Dr. Rayle and the ministrations of his kind nurse,
Mr. Henry Spice, and all<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>that could be
done we could not hold him here; for as the event proved, it was the will of
God that he should pass away to the better home beyond. <br>
As the end drew near, and in the agony of death, a sweet smile was on his face,
as he said to his mother in answer to her question, as she held her face close
to his own., Are you trusting in Jesus? All is well mother, and so sweetly
fell asleep.<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>              </span>The body was carefully
prepared and embalmed by Mr. Landis and his partner undertaker, placed in a
casket beautifully decorated with flowers placed by kind hands, and then,
accompanied by many, although it was a rainy day, conveyed to Wooster, whence
we started by rail for our home near Graysville, Monroe Co.<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>              </span>Another wreath of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Garland</st1:City></st1:place>
was then placed on the casket by kind hands and we parted from those dear
friends with the hope that we might meet again, if not on at last in heaven,
where the parting hand would not be taken.<br>
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>We came via <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Alliance</st1:City></st1:place>,
Wellsville and Bellaire to Woodsfield, where we were met by Mr. James Watson, a
relative, and other kind friends. After being kindly entertained by Mr. Watson
and his family we came by conveyances sent from Graysville to meet us to our
home. Here we found kind friends and neighbors awaiting us, and after a night
of rest with the lifeless body of our precious son Albert that long at home
after his absence of four years, we repaired next morning to the cemetery at
Graysville, where an earnest prayer was offered by Bro. J. W. Devore, and we
laid the precious form to its last earthly rest, after taking a farewell view
of the face so beautiful in death. <br>
We will close this sketch by reference to Matthew 25:34 to 40 inclusive, and
Matthew 10:42 expressing the hope that those who have shown us so great
kindness may share at last all the heavenly blessings and rewards. SAMUEL

took up and conveyed the corpse to the hearse, which was to receive and convey
the same to Beallsville, where her remains were consigned to the narrow limits

<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>              </span>A lovely daughter just grown
up into the most charming womanhood, sickened and died, leaving the mother
shrowded in a gloom of sorrow and grief that well-nigh crushed out her life.
But the light of the star of Bethleham penetrated the darkness of the vale, and
still lighted up her pathway and beckoned her onward and upward, and through
many long sorrowful years she leaned upon the strong arm of her Savior for comfort
and consolation. She was possessed of a clear head and pure heart; of an
intellect far above mediocrity, well stored with useful knowledge, of quick
perception and prompt decision; dignified and courtly in manners; attractive in
conversation. She had long suffered from an incurable affliction, and knew that
death was at the door of the citadel of life. She died without an intervening
cloud, the spirit had gone out to God who gave it. A few more years of service
and the dear ones left behind will meet her in the Fathers home above.<br>

How mildly beam the closing eyes,<br>

Yes, Sadie is gone; how sweet is the sleep,<br>
Of the pure and faithful, then why should we weep?<br>
The Saviour hath promised, hes faithful and true,<br>
To care for and protect us, that promise is sure.<br>

A few more sad tears, bereavements and pain,<br>
Will carry us home to a lamb that was slain;<br>

To Rest<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>              </span>It becomes our very
sorrowful duty this week to chronicle the death of our partner and one of the
editors of the Spiritone who next to our own family stood nearer and dearer to
us than any other one of our many friends.<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>              </span>Bro. Walter J. VanLaw
departed this life at <st1:time Hour="18" Minute="0" w:st="on">6 oclock</st1:time>
on last Sabbath evening at his fathers home in Cameron this county.<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>              </span>He had been ailing since
last February when he had an attack of La Grippe. On recovering from that dread
disease he caught cold, causing an attack of pneumonia which resulted in
consumption causing his death. He made every effort to save his life but all in
vainit seemed that the fates were against him and the reaperdeathmust cut
him down in the bloom of his manhood. Although for the past two months or more,
almost all his friends, had given up hopes of his recovery, his death was a
sorrowful pang to the hearts of all. We first became acquainted with Walter
VanLaw as a brother teacher in this county, then as a pupil when teaching a
select school at Clarington when we recognized his marked ability and learned
to love him for his manliness, energy, honesty, intelligence, true goodness.
From that time we have been bosom friends. When we purchased the Spirit,
knowing the ability of Mr. Van Law, he was sought for a partner and secured an
interest with us <st1:date Year="1886" Day="14" Month="6" w:st="on">the 14<sup>th</sup>
of June, 1886</st1:date>. We have enjoyed the closest and most agreeable
relations until his death. We feel his loss as deeply as that of a brother and
as a business partner, feel that no one can fill his place. His unquestioned
ability connected with his business tact and unlimited social qualifications
won for him distinction as the best of his chosen profession in <st1:place w:st="on">Southeastern
Ohio</st1:place>, and had his life been spared, his untiring energy would have
surely made him peer of any, as an editor and newspaper manager. His short
career as a newspaper man brought him in contact with the people of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Monroe</st1:City></st1:place>,
and his upright business transactions, his intelligence and his pleasant and
social disposition won him legions of true friends among old and young who will
always remember him as a kind friend, a brilliant and exemplary young man.<br>
His popularity was not limited to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Monroe</st1:PlaceName>
<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">County</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> but throughout the
State his ability was quickly recognized by all who came in contact with him
and learned to admire and love him. He hated hypocricy and was a true friend,
and one who had the courage to be a friend in need, and could not be swayed
from what he knew to be right. His splendid newspaper work will be greatly
missed by the people of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Monroe</st1:City></st1:place>
county and the profession in the State.<br>

teaching when he was very younga mere boyand continued teaching and assisting

in the county.<br>
