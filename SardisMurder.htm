<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>In
the town of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Sardis</st1:City></st1:place>,
this county, on Saturday, the 17<sup>th</sup> [<span style='color:black'>July
1875]</span>, was perpetrated one of the most brutal murders that has ever
occurred within our county limits, and there have been some committed that
people thought could hardly be surpassed for cold-blooded brutality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Finding
that it would be impossible to obtain a correct version of the affair without
visiting <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Sardis</st1:City></st1:place>,
we, on Monday, in company with Mr. O. F. Little, drove down and obtained the
following particulars:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>On
the day above mentioned, George and Benjamin Barker, brothers, residents of
Jackson township, went to Sardis, as has been their custom, at times, for years
past, to have a carouse. After their arrival in town, they obtained liquor at a
shop kept by Mrs. <span class=SpellE>Presentine</span>, her husband being in
jail at the time for violating the liquor law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Soon
afterward they each offered to two citizens fifty cents if they would persuade
John Michel to come out of his house. About 5 oclock in the evening they went
into Michels liquor shop, which is in the basement of his dwelling, and called
for liquor. Michel refused to let them have any, when they commenced cursing
and abusing him.-<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Michel
passed round his counter<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>and succeeded
in getting them out of the door, which he immediately locked.- They remained
standing near the door, keeping perfectly quiet, and in a few moments Michel
unlocked and opened it, thinking, no doubt, that they had gone, when both men
sprang upon and shoved him aside, and then commenced a desperate fight in the
cellar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>Fight in the Cellar.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>George
Barker picked up a chair and struck Michel, knocking him down. He then jumped
upon him and stamped him in the face and upon the body in a most brutal manner,
crushing in several of his ribs on the right side, and injuring him on other
parts of his body. At the time George engaged Michel, Ben Barker caught Mrs.
Michel by the throat and was choking her, but before he had injured her very badly,
Mr. Alex McGrew, who had been called in, pulled him away from her, and when
released she struck Ben a heavy blow across the head with a poker, cutting it
severely, and from which blood flowed quite freely. Mr. James <span
class=SpellE>Havely</span> took George off of Michel, and with Mr. McGrews
assistance, succeeded in getting both men out of the door and up the steps to
the street.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Outside
they commenced cursing and swearing and throwing stones through the widows of
the house. They threw a box through a window, tore a shutter off, wrenched
three palings off the gate and threw them in with great violence and also threw
large stones in; for a while it appeared to the citizens as though the fiends
from the lower regions had been loosened, so terrible was the uproar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>When
the Barkers retired from the cellar, Michel went through a back door, up
stairs and procured a single barreled shot-gun and came out the front door into
the street, where the Barkers were, for the purpose of protecting his
property. He struck at George Barker a feeble blow with his clubbed gun, but
missed him, when George seized hold of it and then ensued a <span class=SpellE>tussel</span>
for its possession. While they were engaged Ben Barker picked up a stone about
11 inches long, 3 inches wide and 1 ½ inches in thickness and threw it, striking
Michel on the right side of the face, breaking his jaw bone and knocking him
down. The force with which the stone was thrown broke it about one-third off.
This blow caused him to release his hold of the gun when George Barker Swung it
round, and brought it down on Michels head just behind his left ear, crushing
in the skull, making a hole as large as a silver dollar, and producing a
fracture of 9 inches in length across the crown to just above his right eye.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The
Barkers then paraded the street, back and forth for more than a quarter of an
hour swearing what they could do, and what good men, physically, they were,
after which they started for home, taking Michels gun with them. A short
distance up the street Ben drew his knife and started back swearing he would
have Michels <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:14.0pt'>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>But
George prevailed upon him to go on and let him alone. Near William <span
class=SpellE>Faggerts</span>, three-fourths of a mile below town, George threw
the gun over the fence into the weeds. It was afterwards found by Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Faggert</span>, and proved to have been empty when Michel came
onto the street with it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Michel,
after the Barkers had left, was placed on a lounge and carried through a gate
way to the rear of his house. Mr. Koenig asked him if he was suffering much, and
where the greatest pain was. Notwithstanding the fact that he was almost wholly
unconscious, and pressed it down on his side upon his broken and crushed ribs,
and uttered in guttural tones something like h-e, her, as though trying to
say here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Michels
sufferings were terrible, at one time he raised himself to a sitting posture,
and almost instantly fell back. Dr. Roe was called, but could do nothing to
relieve him. He expired within an hour after being struck with the gun in the
hands of George Barker.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>At
Mr. <span class=SpellE>Faggerts</span>, the Barkers concluded to return to
town for their hats and Bens coat, which had been left on the ground in from
of Michels house. They compelled Mr. <span class=SpellE>Faggert</span> to
accompany them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>They
entered town with stones in their hands, and George had a knife drawn. Mr. A.
R. Bridgman informed them that Michel was dead and they replied that they
didnt care a <span class=SpellE>G___d</span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span><span class=SpellE>d___n</span>. they had sent him to Heaven in a hand
basket.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>An Attempt to Arrest Them<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>They
recovered their hats and coat, and were on their way up the street again, and
had reached Mr. Brannans store, or near there, when two officers, accompanied
by not less than 20 other citizens, approached them and announced that they
proposed to arrest them. Ben replied, all right George swore and oath and
remarked to Ben,  lets run. They dropped the stones they were armed with and
started. Up Street they ran, the citizens following, firing at them with
revolvers. Opposite Mr. J. M. Goodwins store they turned into a lane leading
towards Mr. Jas. Nesbitts new house; the firing still kept up. George was hit
by one shot in the left hip, inflicting a pretty deep but not dangerous flesh
wound. Ben was hit twice, once in the left shoulder, the ball glancing round
under his left arm and stopping nearly over the region of his heart just under
the skin; the other ball struck him in the left shoulder embedding itself, but
making only a flesh wound. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:

style='font-size:14.0pt'>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The shots failed to stop them, and at the end
of the lane both men climbed the fence leading to Mr. Nesbitts house, passed
it, and hid in a corn field just below the house. After searching for some
considerable time George was found. His captors told him to get up and come
along that he had killed Michel. He swore that he hadnt killed anybody, and
didnt know what they meant. He was taken to town, securely chained in the shoe
shop adjoining Mr. John Harmons hotel, and a guard placed over him. Ben could
not be found, although his pursuers were sure that he was concealed in the corn
field. About an hour and a half after the return of the pursuing party to town,
Ben crawled out of some tall grass, made his way down to Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Faggerts</span>, got on his horse, and started home, but from
reports that came from the neighborhood of his home the following day, he
failed to reach there that night, perhaps purposely, and laid out in the woods
all night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>On
Sunday, the 18<sup>th</sup>, two men came into Sardis, and reported that when
Ben hid in the corn field he pulled some long grass over himself, and laid
still; one man stepped over him, that then he thought they would certainly find
him, and not less than a dozen were close to him; and further that Dr. Dally,
of Antioch, had attended him that morning and extracted the balls.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Constable
John Shrive, of Ohio township was sent for on Sunday morning,(Lee township not
having a Constable, both of those elected last Spring refusing to serve) and
given a warrant for Ben Barkers arrest. In the afternoon, accompanied by five
men, he went to Bens house, and was shown Dr. <span class=SpellE>Dallys</span>
written certificate that Ben was not in a condition to be moved. The officer
did not see him, neither did his posse, but it was their impression that he was
concealed not far away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Some
of the friends of Ben, who saw him after the murder was committed, state that
he declared that he would never be taken alive- that he had been in the
penitentiary once, and that he would take his own life before he would ever go
there again. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>In
company with Mr. Jas. Nesbitt and Mr. James <span class=SpellE>Havely</span>,
we went into a shed, or <span class=SpellE>kichen</span>, in the rear of
Michels house to see the remains. The body was in a large pine box, and was
packed in ice. We did not look at his face, it being wrapped about with a
sheet, but was informed that it was fearfully swollen and distorted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Mr. <span class=SpellE>Hoburg</span> and Mr. <span class=SpellE>Hathorn</span>
advised him to give himself up and they would pledge themselves to look after
his family. He replied that he had determined to not be taken by force, and
that he regarded them as being his friends and would take their advice, they
being members of the Grange, to which Order he belonged; and would leave his
wife and children to their car and protection. He then permitted them to arrest
him and was committed as above stated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The
Accounts, published in The Spirit, of this awful tragedy are truly sad and
startling in the extreme. To me these accounts may be, and indeed necessarily
must be more sadly interesting than to many others. They are remembrances of
events which sorrow-stricken hearts would gladly forget. Nothing less than an
earnest desire and hope to benefit some who may perchance read these lines,
induces me to refer to occurrences so unpleasant to dwell upon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Thirty
eight years ago, my life on earth began shout midway between Woodsfield and
Beallsville, and within the boundaries of Monroe County the greater part of my
life has been spent especially my earlier years. Then and there my first
acquaintances were made, friendships established and impressions received.
Beneath her soil, three brothers, one sister, and as good a mother as God ever
gave, now sleep their last sleep<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>These
and other circumstances make whatever incidents that connect themselves with
her history, whether they be of a prosperous or adverse character, all the more
interesting and important to me. The springs and the rivulets, the hills and
the fields, and also the woodlands of Old Monroe, my native county, will to me
never lose their charms.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Whatever
adds luster to her reputation on the one hand, or tarnishes it on the other,
effects me accordingly, either pleasantly or sorrowfully, as it must every
other person who feels for her welfare a like concern. Consequently, there is
room for great grief on the part of all well wishers of their fellow citizens,
over the bloody and brutally murderous deed recently committed at <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Sardis</st1:City></st1:place>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>What
does all this mean? And what is to be done to prevent a like occurrence? Let us
pause and think a moment. The capturing of George Barker and his brother, Ben,
and putting them through a course of law, may satisfy those who think and feel
superficially respecting the moral status of society, but those who have a
better appreciation of the demands of a high degree of civilization and
Christianization will not be, and cannot be, so easily satisfied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Reader,
do you ask, Are you in favor of lynching them? I answer unequivocally NO. The
Barkers are men. Very bad men, and as such, they must now be treated in harmony
with the laws of the country of which they are citizens.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>What
have they done more than has been done several times before in <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Monroe</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">County</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>,
even within my recollection? They got drunk, and thus became tools with which,
in the hands of whisky sellers, to commit murder. In this case it happened that
the victim was a liquor seller. I rejoice in no mans death or injury, but feel
much better satisfied with the result than if the victim had been some innocent
woman or child, as is often the case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Some
one might suggest that there is one way in which the result might have been
bettered, <span class=SpellE>viz</span>: by Mrs. M. dealing out such blows with
that poker, on the pates of both murderers of her husband, as would have been to
them also a constant quiet; after which she should have (should do so anyhow)
at once declared her house no longer a sink-hole of vice, and deeply repented
of having engaged in such a nefarious business, leading to such terrible ends.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>But
remember that George Barker declares he has no recollection of having done any
violence to the unfortunate <span class=SpellE>saloonist</span>- Mr. Michel.
This may be true. Of course there is but little confidence to be put in the
word of either the seller or drinker of whiskey.- that is, respecting the
traffic, for respecting other matter they may be as reliable as other people.
But whether George Barker was conscious or not of the violence he was doing Mr.
Michel, one thing I think may be safely affirmed of him, <span class=SpellE>viz</span>:
Had he not been drunk he would not have committed the deed. As much might be
affirmed of Ben Barker.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>But
you may say they always had the devil in them. Grant it; but they could always
manage toe sober devil until he was reinforced by the drunken devil.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the public ear by sport making of that <span class=SpellE>unforturnate</span>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The
charge that <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Monroe</st1:City></st1:place>
county has failed of duty as regards to the great questions of sobriety and
morality may not be well taken by some, and without explanation is quite liable
to be misunderstood.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>As
serious as it appears it could not easily be made more mild. If<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>there have been no such failures, how then
can we account for the awful crimes committed, year after year, upon her soil?
And how can we hope for anything better in the future? And why urge reformation
in the pulpit or through the press, if there be no room for it?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>But
it is a foregone conclusion that those bloody deeds would not have been
committed had it not been for drunkenness. If this conclusion be not correct, let
it be shown to be incorrect. Boldly and yet kindly does it challenge
investigation. Probably no one will be found who will dare day that Craig,
Henderson, or any one of the notorious Barkers, with others who might be
mentioned as Monroe countys murderers, not even excepting the money loving
Daniel Salisbury, would have ever been accused of murder had it not been for
the great evil that I do most earnestly desire to help talk down, write down,
pray down and also force down. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>As
drunkenness is a most fruitful cause of murder, than which there is no greater
crime, if follows that any community will prevent much of the latter by
removing the former- its acknowledged fruitful source.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>To
do this is a consummation greatly to be wished. To be indifferent respecting
such a result seems to me would not be very commendable to any one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>In
thus finding security against like occurrences, namely, by the destruction of
their most fruitful cause, we are naturally led to consider the various
influences and causes which tend to drunkenness itself. In the investigation of
these the reader will likely see the main respect in which it is regarded that
the people of Old Monroe have not done righteously.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
